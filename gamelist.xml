The updates are largely cosmetic, with the game retaining the same top-down view and field minimap. Of course, the full 1994 J.League team and player roster is included. The exhibition, playoff, and league modes are back from the first game, as well as the all-star mode that was added in its update. Once again, up to four players can play simultaneously, and the menu system has also been greatly streamlined.</desc>

		<name>Uchuu Senkan Gomora</name>
		<desc>Atlantal, a peaceful planet, has been attacked by an invading alien fleet known only as The Aggressors, leaving the capital city Delila in ruins. In order to sop The Aggressors, the people of Atlantal send the most powerful fighter ship on the planet, the bio-ship Gomorrah.

Uchu Senkan Gomorrah (Space Battle Ship Gomorrah) is a horizontally-scrolling shooter based on the 1990 coin-op of the same title. The player controls the titular ship, Gomorrah, which can shoot both straight forward as in most shooting games, as well as freely in any direction via an aiming cursor, which is controlled independently of the ship itself. Additionally, there are several power-ups that can be found, including speed-ups, additional mounted guns, and the life-up, which will not only increase the ship's armor, but also cause it to grow in size as well.

The game features 9 stages, each with a boss at the end, as well as one or two-player simultaneous play. The game difficulty has been rebalanced from the arcade to compensate for the lack of a trackball to control the aiming cursor; the player must stop their ship in order to move the cursor.</desc>

		<name>Premier Manager 97</name>
		<desc>Premier Manager 97 is the second Mega Drive game in the hit football managing game series of the early nineties. Similar to the first run of games in the series (released between 1992 and 1994), the manager starts (in the Full Game mode) as a lowly division 3 (not Conference) manager, where the goal is to get the club to the top divisions, or get signed to better placed teams. In the Demo mode, the player can choose any Premier League team, but only for a season.

In either of the modes, the player is responsible for carefully assembling the team (and unlike other managers, selecting the appropriate tactics is crucial to win the game), get the best from the transfer market by selling the fading stars and outselling the biggest clubs in England in the quest for the stars of the future, improve stadium capacity and quality (including seating, roof, security and others), sign good deals for ground advertising and balance the budget to make the team finish the season out of the red.

Matches are always simulated, with a ruler showing where the ball is, and with text messages showing actions (like "player passes", player tackles" and so on). The chances of goals are shown in LED-style animated clips.</desc>

You run around the levels avoiding sharp flying objects and fighting any enemies that get in your way, including the numerous bosses. If your in a tight spot you can
call Arthur to help defeat any enemies that are on-screen. The game is presented in a normal 2D platformer view when you're just jumping from building to building, but changes to a semi-isometric view when you start fighting. You'll probably like it if you like Streets of Rage.</desc>

Game modes include exhibition, tour and tournament for both singles and doubles.

Along the usual offering of lobs, volleys, passing shots, top spins and slashes, the player can leave player movement to the console, and just focus on hitting the ball with the right shot with the correct timing (the player can also set the playing style, from all-court, baseline, or rush net). For those needing a boost of confidence before entering competitive play, Vic Braden, one of the most well known tennis coaches, has a court with special lines, a ball machine and some hints to help them improve their play.</desc>

		<path>./Red Zone (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Red Zone</name>
		<desc>Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator.  Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.

The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea.  Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series.  Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.

Interspersed with the plentiful in-chopper combat, there are numerous mission-oriented sequences in which the occupants of the helicopter disembark and perform missions on-foot inside of buildings.  Each of the three characters have a unique set of weapons, and the player can choose from either of the three to use, so long as none of them have been killed during previous on-foot missions.

Red Zone bears many gameplay similarities to the early entries of the Strike series of games, though while the first three games of that series had a fixed isometric point-of-view, Red Zone has a straight-down POV that rotates along with the helicopter.  Red Zone is also highly reminiscent of Zyrinx's earlier and similarly technologically advanced Genesis game Sub-Terrania, with the most notable similarities being in the relative difficulty of the games, and in the manipulation of the Genesis' hardware into providing visual effects not seen in other games, such as simulated video.</desc>

		<name>Zan Yasha Enbukyoku</name>
		<desc>Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.

The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. 

The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the 1994 movie of the same name starring Ray Liotta, the player takes control of Liotta's character, Capt. J.T. Robbins, whose only objective of the game is to escape an island. After shooting his commanding officer, Robbins is imprisoned and eventually sent to the island Absolom as a war criminal, from where there is no escape possible. To do this still, the player must explore the island with side-scrolling platform gameplay for clues, finding items and combining them to make weapons and traps.  

Robbins can talk to some prisoners to help him in his quest, but he must also avoid violent prisoners, either by attacking them with punches or kicks or using traps and stealth to bypass them. The graphics are based off of rotoscopes of the actual actors from the movie.</desc>

		<name>Phantasy Star II : Shilka's Adventure</name>
		<desc>Phantasy Star II Text Adventures were a series of eight text adventure videogames available to users of Sega Meganet, a modem for the Sega Mega Drive in Japan, and later released as part of two compilations on the Sega Mega-CD. Each of the games takes place shortly before Phantasy Star II, documenting the backgrounds of its characters, and explaining what brings them to the town Paseo where they eventually team up to investigate the pervasive troubles of the Algol Solar System.

Shilka's Adventure: Shilka or Shir on American and European versions. She is the only heiress of a rich family in Paseo, the capital of the planet Motavia. Instead of spending her time doing nothing and remedying the monotony of everyday life, she became an expert thief. She likes to take the air, the freshness of the night breeze and often rests on the roofs. It is called "Shir of the Wind". His adventure takes place in autumn of the interstellar year 1282, about two years before the events that take place in Phantasy Star II. She plans to steal a painting entitled "Opa-Opa", which is on display in an exhibition hotel.</desc>

		<path>./Championship Pool (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Championship Pool</name>
		<desc>Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off with the BCA Regional Championship where the player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four games match. If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.

All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. 

There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:

1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.

2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:

1. 14.1 Challenge &#8211; After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.

2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

4. Equal Offence &#8211; Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.

5. Three Pool &#8211; Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three balls in with lower been better.

6. Speed Pool &#8211; Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other than taking longer).

3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 2 to 8 human players. The games are:

1. Eight Ball (2 Players)  &#8211; A standard eight ball game with the players taking turns to play.

7. Nine Ball (2-8 Players)  &#8211; A standard nine ball game with up to 8 players taking turns. First player to get the 9-ball in wins.

8. 14.1 Continuous (2 Players)  &#8211; Players can hit any ball in for a point. If a shot is missed then other player plays. If there is only one ball on the table the pocketed balls are re-racked. Play continues until one of the players reaches the score chosen at the start of the game.

9. Ten Ball (2-8 Players)  &#8211; Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.

10. Rotation (2-8 Players)  &#8211; Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

11. Straight Pool (2 Players)  &#8211;  Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game wins.

12. Equal Offence (2-8 Players)  &#8211;  Same as Equal Offence in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.

13. Fifteen Ball (2-8 Players)  &#8211; Same as Rotation except that any ball can be hit not just the lowest.

14. One Pocket (2 Players)  &#8211; The two players are given one of the two pockets at the end of the table. The player must hit all the balls in there nominated pocket with the one with the most balls wins.

  
Three Ball (2-8 Players)  &#8211; Same as Three Ball in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each other&#8217;s score.

		<desc>Lakya is a technologically-advanced civilization on a planet far from our own galaxy. The planet's inhabitants have unknowingly unleashed the planet's life force, Evol. As the Evol drifts from Lakya, it reaches a planet called Cokyo, whose inhabitants use it to attack and invade Lakya. Now, fighters from Lakya must fight back against the invading army by using the Evol themselves.

Darwin 4081 is a vertical scrolling shooter based on the 1987 Data East coin-op Super Real Darwin. The main attraction of the game is the ability to evolve your ship into a wide variety of different forms, each with their own attack abilities, by collecting DNA dropped by enemies. Other powerups will increase you ship's speed, give you an option that follows your ship, or even increase the power of your smart bombs. The game features surreal futuristic art design fitting of its title.</desc>

		<desc>The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).</desc>

		<name>Olympic Gold</name>
		<desc>The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.

Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.
Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.

The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).</desc>

		<desc>Gil Hazard, president of the Hazard Foundation, is secretly Professor G, the leader of the evil Dark Hazard organization. He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.

Battle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.</desc>

		<name>Super Volleyball</name>
		<desc>Super Volleyball is an indoor volleyball game for one or two players. The single player mode offers two game options: normal game and World League. Choosing normal game pits the player against the computer in a single game. Choosing World League pits the player against all other teams available. A password save is available in this mode.

The game features eight national teams (USA, USSR, Brazil, Holland, France, Italy, Japan and China), with fictitiously named players. Players can be changed during gameplay by pressing C. There is also an option to create new teams, choosing the team's name, color, player's position and names.

Gameplay is viewed from a side scrolling perspective, with the camera fixed on the ball. A small radar on the top of the screen shows the players' positions of both teams. Players can, bump, set, spike, dump, block and dig. A collection of serves is also available: underhand, overhand and jump serve. There are also options for three ball speeds, beginning points (from 0 to 10, out of 15) and handicap.</desc>

		<desc>You are Joe, a young American who has been secretly training to become a powerful fighter. One day, he meets an old martial artist who tells him he should travel all over the world to meet other teachers and to learn from them. During his travels, Joe encounters many other fighters, and has to become more and more skillful in order to prove that he is the greatest fighter in the world.

Unlike most other fighting games, you can control only one character (Joe) in single-player mode. In two-player mode, you can choose to fight as any of the seven available fighters, and also choose a scenery. The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.</desc>

In the arcade mode, the player can decide the number of enemy air and ground units, the environment, length of mission, and the difficulty level. This mode allows the player to hone their skills in order to prepare for the campaign mode. 

The campaign mode is the main part of the game and contains 30 missions. The game includes nine theaters of combat such as training missions in the Nevada Desert, to the conflict in Panama, and also to the Gulf War. Each mission has a primary object that must be destroyed in order to advance to the next mission.</desc>

		<desc>Space Harrier II follows (very closely) in the footsteps of its predecessor and involves you (a Space Harrier) going off to save "Fantasy Land". This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip.

There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.

The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.</desc>

		<desc>One windy day, there was an explosion at a nuclear power station, causing heavy doses of radiation to be poured over many people. One of these people was a young scientist named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</desc>

Unfortunately, Earl wasn't paying enough attention to where he was driving, and ran the ship into an asteroid.  The ship crash landed onto the most bizarre planet in the galaxy: Earth.

Toejam and Earl must travel from level to level on Earth and collect the 10 scattered pieces of the ship. But the various Earthlings, such as Nerd Herds, Giant Hamsters, Phantom Ice Cream Trucks and the Bogeyman will make that difficult.

The power up items that TJ and E can pick up come in the form of wrapped presents. You never really know what a power up is until you open it. What's more, randomized levels and item locations make it a different game every time.

The game features a dynamic screen splitting - screen joining 2-player mode.
Players start the game close to each other. If one gets away from the other, the screen vertically splits to allow each player to move freely. When players are close again, the screens join together to become one single screen.</desc>

Want to see how the 1986 Mets might have done against the 1987 Twins? Here's your chance.

The game was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players' Association; thus, real Major League players and statistics are included, but the teams themselves are represented only by their home cities. Team names are not used. Also, retired players who were no longer under contract with the MLBPA in 1991 are not present. Rather, they are represented by their initials and their fielding positions.

Game mechanics remain unchanged from R.B.I. Baseball 2, focusing more on arcade fun than realistic gameplay.</desc>

You are equipped with a gun: tons of enemies will attack you from all the sides, so your best bet will be walking with the fire button pressed down. You can shoot to all the directions and also engage in melee combat when the enemy is too close. Each level has a boss enemy waiting for you in the end.

		<path>./Sparkster (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Sparkster</name>
		<desc>Sparkster is the sequel to Rocket Knight Adventures and is completely different from the contemporary SNES title Sparkster. It takes place immediately after the events of the first game. The interactive introduction scene shows Sparkster picking up a new sword after the final fight when his nemesis Axel Gear appears, the rocket knight gone evil. After a fight in giant robots, Sparkster manages to save Princess Cherry and returns her to the queen. Then suddenly Axel appears again and he kidnaps her. It turns out Axel is working once more for the Empire of Gedol. Sparkster has to return the peace in Kingdom of Zebulos, save the princess and bring an end to the evil empire.

The game consists of six levels with 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay. The opossum Sparkster can move around, jump and attack with his sword. Using his rocket pack, he can also perform stronger attacks and burst through the air in different directions. The rocket power consists of a double meter that refills gradually, making it possible to perform successive attacks in the air, ricocheting off walls. The first meter allows for the strongest attacks, but fills more slowly. Sparkster collects diamonds, apples to restore health and different types of power-ups for his sword. Most levels have typical platform gameplay, but there is also a level where Sparkster walks around in a giant robot, knocking enemies out of the air.

For an additional challenge players can locate the seven swords hidden throughout the levels. When all of them have been found, the hero turns into Golden Sparkster. The game includes a password system.</desc>

		<path>./Show do Milhao (Brazil).zip</path>
		<name>Show do Milhao</name>
		<desc>Show do Milh&#227;o is based on a Brazilian TV game show by the same name, hosted by Silvio Santos, a famous Brazilian TV presenter, owner of SBT, one of the greatest TV channels in Brazil.

Show do Milh&#227;o (One Million Show, in English) is basically a quiz game, with 16 questions divided in three blocks of five questions each, plus the one million question. Each question has 4 alternative answers, of which just one is right. The player wins a money prize for each right question. If he decides to stop at a certain question, he wins half of the questions' prize. If he guesses wrong, wins a quarter of the prize. But the rules are different for the last question: if he guesses wrong, he looses all the money he has won during the game. If he stops, takes half the prize as usual.

The player can also skip questions up to three times. If he skips a question, other one with the same prize is displayed. He can also ask for help, which comes in three different manners: cards, players and guests.

If the player chooses the cards help, he must pick one of three shuffled cards (K, A, 2 and 3), each one corresponding to the amount of wrong choices that will be removed from the screen (the K meaning no removal at all).

If the player chooses the other (in this case, simulated) players help, a screen showing the percentage of players guessing each answer will appear (in the real game show, many players participated each night, taking their turns at the central place).

If the player chooses the guests help, three guests will take their guesses on the answer, and you can go by their guesses or not (on the real game show, those guests were college students).

The game features the digitized voice of Silvio Santos, as well as the show's main theme. All the text is in Portuguese.</desc>

To this end, he has created a giant roboticizing machine called the "Mean Bean-Steaming Machine" to use on the jolly bean folk. Putting his plan into motion, Robotnik sends out his henchbots to round up all the unfortunate bean folk and group them together in dark dungeons so they can be sent to the Mean Bean-Steaming Machine.

Assuming the role of Has Bean, the player must now stand up against Robotnik's henchmen by breaking into the dungeons, freeing the bean folk before it is too late, and get through Robotnik's henchbots to the deranged doctor himself and foil his evil plans once and for all.</desc>

You can play these teams in a regular exhibition game or sudden death overtime game, or take the 1993 teams through an entire season. You can also enter the playoffs with the 1993 teams, the Super Bowl champions, or the All Star franchise teams.

The player must guide an army of dinosaurs to victory against their opponents, who are aliens that have invaded Earth. The player's main base and source of life is "The Egg", from which other life forms are spawned. The enemy's base is represented by a UFO. Players have the choice of creating over five different types of dinosaurs: a stegosaurus, triceratops, tyrannosaurus rex, allosaurus, and lastly, an oviraptor. The player uses each dinosaur's unique ability to gather power points to spend in executing commands. This includes sending rain showers to grow vegetation, causing disasters, giving specific directions, and so on.</desc>

		<name>King's Bounty : The Conqueror's Quest</name>
		<desc>As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order.  A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.

Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.

You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.

There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.

As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga no Yabou : Haouden</name>
		<desc>Nobunaga no Yabou: Haouden ("Nobunaga's Ambition: Tale of the Conquerer") is a strategy-sim from Koei and the fifth in their flagship Nobunaga's Ambition series of Sengoku-era feudal sims. Once again, the player assumes one of a number of daimyos, including Oda Nobunaga himself, and tries to take over the rest of Japan. It was originally released in 1992 for the PC-9801 home computer and ported to various other computers and consoles of the period.

Among the tweaks to the gameplay was the addition of castles, which are now the locations that players must conquer in order to take over new territory. Haouden was also the first game in the series to be given an expansion pack, though this pack would not be available to all versions of the game.

The game was the first flagship Nobunaga's Ambition game to never receive a US localization. It sits between the fourth game, Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness (Nobunaga no Yabou: Bushou Fuuunroku) from 1990, and the sixth game, Nobunaga no Yabou: Tenshouki from 1994.</desc>

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.</desc>

It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.

You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</desc>

The idyllic life of the Alurean people was shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.

The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.

There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Eraser</name>
		<desc>Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:

1. Round: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.

2. Normal: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.

3. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.

4. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.

These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.</desc>

		<path>./Sonic 3D Blast (USA, Europe, Korea) (En).zip</path>
		<name>Sonic 3D Blast</name>
		<desc>Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left and right. While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that the Flickies, his small, feathered friends that can travel between parallel worlds, were captured and turned into badniks (the robot enemies of Sonic) by Dr. Robotnik in his never-ending quest for the Chaos Emeralds. Seven levels separate Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik. Gameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue tokens. Unlike all other previous games, time isn't a requirement: if the player completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.</desc>

		<name>Phantasy Star II : Kinds's Adventure</name>
		<desc>Phantasy Star II Text Adventures were a series of eight text adventure videogames available to users of Sega Meganet, a modem for the Sega Mega Drive in Japan, and later released as part of two compilations on the Sega Mega-CD. Each of the games takes place shortly before Phantasy Star II, documenting the backgrounds of its characters, and explaining what brings them to the town Paseo where they eventually team up to investigate the pervasive troubles of the Algol Solar System.

Kinds's Adventure: Kind (Josh on the American and European versions), aged 18, is an aspiring engineer. He has always loved machines and knows perfectly how robots work. He built many small devices and knows how to hack computers. However, being head in the air, it often destroys things, but tries nevertheless to repair them. Finally, after being a "repairer" with little talent, he decided instead to put his talent to the destruction of machines, but for good reasons. He began to join a gang of rebels to destroy Mother Brain, the great electronic brain of the Algol solar system. And finally, he ends up teaming up with Rolf in Phantasy Star II.</desc>

		<path>./Bubble and Squeak (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Bubble and Squeak</name>
		<desc>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.

Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.

Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.

In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater &#8211; completing these earns bonuses.</desc>

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.

The version released in Japan has English text and adds trackball support, more difficulty levels, and music closer to the arcade original.</desc>

		<name>Marsupilami</name>
		<desc>Based on the character developed by Belgian cartoon artist Franquin, this platform features the player controlling Marsupilami, a strange animal with a large tail, who was poached along with Bonelli the Elephant from the Palombian jungle by Bring M. Backalive and sold to a Circus. Seizing the opportunity when the animal trainer fell asleep, Marsupilami got the key using his long tail and released all animals, and with the help of their Palombian friends No&#233;, Bip and Sarah tries to return to Palombia.

While it might seem a typical platform game at first sight, it  includes a twist: Instead of dozens of enemies, Marsupilami has to guide Bonelli through gaps and other obstacles (not much different than the Earthworm Jim levels where Jim has to steer Peter Puppy to safety), by shaping his tail intro stairs, bridges or an umbrella, but to do so, he must first collect an icon with the abilities required to complete the level, up to four on each. Always available is the ability to shape into a giant fist not only to swat guards and other enemies away, but also to change Bonelli's direction. The player also collects fruits along the way, which not only provide extra points at the end of the level, but can be dropped out to slow down Bonelli. Each level is timed, so the player can't make many mistakes, even if some time bonus items are occasionally available.</desc>

Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his adventure, he's going to need all the help he can get.

As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls. Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs. It's also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.</desc>

		<name>Tyrants : Fight through Time</name>
		<desc>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. 

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.
 
Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.

Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.

If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.

The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. 

You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.</desc>

		<desc>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.

Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. 

Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.

There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</desc>

		<name>Fantastic Dizzy</name>
		<desc>The evil wizard Zaks has cast a spell on the peaceful Yolkfolk, and while many fell under his spell, others have other problems to deal with, including Dizzy, who saw his girlfriend Daisy kidnapped and taken hostage by Zaks, and it's up to him to restore the Yolkfolk to normal and rescue Daisy from the top of the Cloud Castle's tower.

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone. 

Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.</desc>

		<name>James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing</name>
		<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>

Weather can be customised in the Time Attack mode but is randomly chosen in Grand Prix mode, while you can only choose one of the D-tier teams (the 4 weakest of the 16) in grand Prix mode, but can drive for McLaren, Williams et al in Time Attack.</desc>

The terrorists are now in control of the satellite communication network, and they threaten to destroy the world's greatest cities with nuclear bombs. The group is only prepared to cancel their threats when the world's leaders are ready to give their power to DAGGER.

As a counter-offense, a special forces air unit is called in by the president of the USA. The air unit's code name: "Vapor Trail". The world's last hope lies in your hands now...

The game is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up. You can choose between 3 planes; the fast but weak plane: Seylen. The mediocre all around: Silph; and the slow but very strong: Valkyrie.
During the game you can pick up various items. These items include: Speed-up, power-up and extra lives. An extra useful feature is the spin-dash which makes you invulnerable for a few seconds. For this feature you have to wait until your power is restored to full by waiting some time. You also get more than one boss per level.</desc>

A wicked group has invaded the "Skyscraper" and has tried to make it their own. If the situation is left as it is, the place would eventually be controlled by the wicked group.

Rastan Saga 2 is the sequel to Rastan,   containing the same hack-em'/slash-'em gameplay as the original. You are a warrior who must get through a number of levels, and trying to collect gems which can only be obtained by defeating the end-of-level bosses.  Collecting power-ups along the way awards you with extra life or better weapons.</desc>

		<desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

		<name>NHL Hockey '94</name>
		<desc>After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in NHL '94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in the series.

Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides). 

While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</desc>

		<path>./New Horizons (USA).zip</path>
		<name>New Horizons</name>
		<desc>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:

1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.

2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.

3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.

4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.

5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...

6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.

Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.</desc>

Gameplay is identical to the previous games, you control Opa-Opa on a freely scrolling 2D game world and you must seek and destroy all the enemy generators in each level in classic arcade shooter fashion and then face a boss fight. Upon successful completion of a level, you get to spend the coins you collected on it at an upgrade shop, fitting your ship with better weapons and upgrades, and then you head out for the next level.

Small changes in gameplay include the removal of the automatic orientation control as in the Game Gear Fantasy Zone, expanded control mapping that takes advantage of the Mega Drive's extra buttons, and more weapons and items to upgrade your ship with.</desc>

		<name>Dangerous Seed</name>
		<desc>It is the 25th century, and the solar system has come under attack by an mysterious alien enemy known as Dangerous Seed. Human forces have been decimated, and the aliens' next target is Earth! The enemy draws closer to the frontline base on the moon by the hour, and the final line of defense for Earth, the fighter ship Moon Diver, has launched.

Dangerous Seed is a vertical scrolling shooter converted from the 1989 Namco coin-op. The player controls the three-part fighter ship Moon Diver through 12 stages to confront the alien menace and secure peace in the solar system. Each of the three parts of the ship, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, have their own properties which can be combined in various ways. Each type and combination has multiple shot types which can be powered up, and there are also options and bombs available which contribute to Moon Diver's extensive arsenal.</desc>

		<name>Menacer 6-Game Cartridge</name>
		<desc>Menacer 6-Game Cartridge was released as a pack-in cartridge for the Menacer light gun. It is a compilation of six games:

1. Pest Control: in this game the player has to defend a pizza from the attack of assorted bugs. The player smokes the bugs while controlling a spotlight, but it is also possible to see the whole table while pressing a second button (in this case, it won't be possible to use the insecticide). The game is over when the pizza is all eaten. Different bugs will appear throughout the levels, such as some big ones which explode in smaller ones when shot.

2. Space Station Defender: the player has to shoot aliens inside pods which appear on the screen in a given sequence and in specific positions. As the player follows the pattern, he has to reload the weapon by aiming the lower end of the screen where "power" can be read. There's also a random mode, where all pods appear at the same time and the player has to guess the order in which they'll open. The aliens shoot back if the player takes much time to shoot them. Once in a while a little flying saucer will cross the screen; shooting it will give the player a shield point. The game is over when player's life is depleted.

3. Ready, Aim, Tomatoes!: this game is set in Toejam &amp; Earl's universe. As the screen scrolls right, Toejam has to shoot tomatoes at enemies such as the Cupid, the Dentist, the Boogie Man, the little Devil and so on. There are also special items to shoot, like bombs which will kill all enemies at the screen or tomato baskets which will give ammunition. For each level there's a target score to achieve. In advanced levels the enemies will shoot back. The game is over when Toejam's life is depleted.

4. Whack Ball: this is some sort of a Breakout game. The player controls a paddle and has to bounce a ball against a frame of blocks. Once a block is touched by the ball, its color is changed, and the objective is to change all blocks colors. Some glowing blocks have special effects when hit like sticking the ball to the paddle, giving an extra ball or shrinking the paddle. A time limit is given to each leval, and if the player doesn't succeed, another chance is given. The game is over when all balls are lost though the holes in the frame.

5. Front Line: in this game the player has to shoot tanks, trucks, planes and helicopters before they shoot back. There are two weapons available: a cannon with unlimited ammo and 10 missiles per stage.

6. Rockman's Zone: in this game the player has to shoot cardboard pictures of bandits while avoiding shooting pictures of women, children and policemen. Bonus points are given for acurracy.

In the shooting games the player can choose to have the Accu-Sight on or off. If it is on, a crosshair will be displayed. If it's off, the player can also choose to use the Menacer's Binocular Module.</desc>

When the prince returns, he finds the house under attack by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek help in the castle of a baron, whose country has long been allied with theirs. However, the baron betrays Selios' trust and imprisons him. The young prince manages to escape, but with no way back, he has no choice but to wander around the country, trying to find trustworthy companions who would help him save his country.
nnThis is a traditional Japanese RPG, with turn-based combat, viewed from the first person perspective. Enemies are semi-random: they appear out of nowhere, but they are visible on the screen, and if you run away from a battle, they will chase you.</desc>

		<desc>The city of New York is certainly a great place to be, but not when there's the criminal element running about. Lucky for the NYPD, there's also the heroic Spider-Man on their side!

But now one of the biggest criminals in the city, Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. The Kingpin, has pulled of the ultimate plot! He announces to New York that a bomb has been planted somewhere in the city, and that it'll go off in 24 hours! What's worse, he lays the blame on Spider-Man, and now the webslinger is on his own, and on the run from the police. Spidey smells a rat, and he knows what he must do.

Spidey has 24 hours to find and disarm that bomb. And he must also clear his name, so he takes his camera to take convincing photos for his Spider-Man hating boss, J. Jonah Jameson, and the police, to prove his innocence. Along the way, he just may run into a few of his *AHEM* "old friends", including Dr. Octopus, Electro, Mysterio, and ultimately Kingpin himself!</desc>

		<desc>This soccer game lets you choose a team representing one of twenty-four countries around the world to participate in the World Championship tournament. This is identical to the real 1990 World Cup.

Once you pick your team you can also select which players you want on the field, so that you can round out the team's strengths and weaknesses. Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, either against the computer or against a friend.

The action is viewed from above with large player sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are no free kicks. Whereas later sports games often carry heavy focus on the attention to detail, this game is rather simplified -- you can only control the player closest to the ball, for example, and it is missing many of the rules of soccer such as penalty flags and offsides.</desc>

An omnipotent race known as Primaries offers to save the inhabitants of one of the twelve star systems. Each star system sends a warrior to compete in a tournament to preserve their star system.

Fighting Masters is an early one-on-one fighter with limited controls. Three buttons are available in the game: block, attack and jump. The D-pad cannot be used to jump directly. Instead, the player has to walk in a certain direction and then press the jump key to perform it. Although there are no combos available, the attack key offers different moves and a few special moves are available as well. Most of the fighting leads to holds from which massive damage can be inflicted by dropping the opponent or throwing him against the wall. Twelve different fighters have available. Aside from the moves, some are also faster or come with more powerful attacks. The game modes include matches for one or two players and a watch mode to view a computer-computer fight.</desc>

		<name>Wings of Wor</name>
		<desc>Gynoug is a horror-themed shoot'em up similar to Thunder Force and other horizontal shooters. But other than most of them where you play a spaceship of some sort, here you play as Wor, a member of the so-called 'Flying men' who look quite similar to angels.
The home planet of these people, Iccus, has been taken over by a virus that has mutated into a collection of quite horrible creatures, and every previous attempt to battle them has failed. So now it is Wor's turn to save his home planet and destroy these mutants once and for all!

Gynoug consists of 6 levels with no check points, instead you continue right where you died if you have any lifes left. Each level (except the last) has a mid-boss and a large end-boss. There are three types of shots, one that fires in a triangular fashion, one that fires more concentrated in a corridor and a bit to the back and above/below you, and one that fires to the front and back simultaneously. You can power them up in two ways, by shooting more bullets and by strengthening them. Also, feathers can increase your speed like in Gradius.</desc>

		<name>Mario Lemieux Hockey</name>
		<desc>This hockey game contains an exhibition, tournament, shootout, and a fight mode. It also has 16 teams that represent the cities of real NHL teams but the game does not contain either real NHL teams or players.

Exhibition mode is just a one on one matchup between 2 teams.

In the tournament mode, a team must win to advance to the next round. If a team loses they are eliminated. 

The shootout mode consists of two teams  who take turns taking shots at the goalie and whoever scores the most goals
wins. 

Fight mode consists of two hockey players fighting each other until either of their energy bars runs out. This mode is good to get some practice because when the fight happens in a hockey game the loser of the fight gets sent to the penalty box.

There are three skill levels and four period-lengths to choose from. The game also has an option to make the referee either blind, fair, or tough which affects the frequency of penalties.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends</name>
		<desc>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel.  The game plays out much like an episode of the show.  The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.</desc>

The game is a first person RPG, with turn-based combat and cartoony graphics. The dialogue is displayed via dialog bubbles appearing above the characters speaking, although the protagonist never speaks. There are no sub-quests - the secrets in the game involve  the location and use of special metal for forging esoteric items. There are about 25 to 30 hours of gameplay to be found here, before the final battle and ending sequence.</desc>

		<name>Streets of Rage</name>
		<desc>Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</desc>

		<name>Australian Rugby League</name>
		<desc>Australian Rugby League is the "sequel" of some sorts of Rugby World Cup 95, but focusing on Rugby League rather than Union. In addition to the 20-team league that names the game and the State of Origin, a competition between two selections of players from New South Wales and Queensland, an European League (composed by twelve teams) and international playoffs (eight) are also available. It is possible to play friendlies, or jump straight to the club competition playoffs.

Gameplay is simple, and focus on quick passing and running rather than kicking to gain distance. The A button controls kicks the ball (tackles in defense), B passes (or changes players) and C rushes and breaks tackles. There are a few additional tricks, such as pressing A+B to perform a short, lobbed kick or A+C to clear the ball from the defense. Kicking from a dead ball situation uses a three-click method. The first sets the bar in motion, the second the strength, and the third the accuracy. The stronger the shot, the less accurate it will be, and the initial position of the kicker also affects the direction of the ball. Each button represents a different ball height, from A (which is the lowest) to C (highest). Weather also affects how the game is played, as high temperatures with hard grounds make longer games tougher on the players (slowing them down) and cold, wet weather makes passing the ball more difficult.</desc>

		<name>Twin Hawk</name>
		<desc>Twin Hawk is a typical vertical scrolling shooter with a top-down view. Your goal is easy, shoot all the enemies along the way. You only get a standard gun on your plane, and no bombs! Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies.

Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are 3 types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives.</desc>

With over 800 players based on the 1992 season, all of the series trademarks including play-by-play commentary, authentic playbooks and instant replays are intact. Battery backup support is available for season play.

		<desc>The game situates itself on the "Isla Sorna" sites of Jurassic Park, a concept originally based on the Steven Spielberg series of movies. You play the role of a bounty hunter trying to catch some prized dinosaurs. This game is not a side scrolling platform game like the other two Jurassic Park games on the Genesis. This is a top-down view game like the SNES version of Jurassic Park, with gameplay similar to The Chaos Engine.

Each of the four Isla Sorna sites contains three missions. Once you have completed the three missions you unlock the boss mission. For a change in the game, the boss missions are 3D look-alike levels. Once the four sites are cleared you get two more final missions to complete the game.</desc>

		<name>Fire Shark</name>
		<desc>Fire Shark takes place around a small island in the South Pacific.  It is a continuously-scrolling aerial shooter with a top-down view.  Your World War II era biplane has been modified to shoot lasers and drop powerful bombs. 

There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock you from the sky. 

In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and maintenance.  You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.

There are also many power-ups available in each level.  Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes.  Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed.  These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.

The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot.  As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16.  The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.

The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire.  It will fire continuously while the fire button is held.  Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.</desc>

		<path>./RoboCop Versus The Terminator (USA).zip</path>
		<name>RoboCop versus The Terminator</name>
		<desc>The Dark Horse comic book crossover of the two famous 80s cyborgs spawned various different game adaptations. RoboCop versus The Terminator on the Genesis is only loosely based on the comic.

The player controls RoboCop who during his duty of policing the streets of Detroit is lured into a trap by Terminators sent from the future. By uploading himself into the computer network, he becomes the seed from which the malevolent Skynet grows. Years later, in the post-apocalyptic future, RoboCop is reactivated and must help the human resistance by attacking and defeating Skynet once and for all.

The game is a platformer with heavy shooting elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies stand in RoboCop's way and must be destroyed via 8 different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried at the same time and being killed means the currently equipped gun is lost.

The game is evenly split between present and future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include mostly street punks and other criminal elements while the future is of course populated by deadly machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders and many automated guns. Each level ends with a boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks and RoboCop's famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain (aka RoboCop 2).

Some levels feature optional goals besides getting to the exit, like freeing hostages or destroying security cameras.</desc>

Instead of a generic stadium, all 28 teams have their own ballparks modeled after the real deal. On top of the regular team vs team mode, (in either a single game, best of 7, you vs the division, or you vs the entire league) you can spend time in a home run derby or fielding practice. Also includes rosters of every division champ from 1984 onwards for Game Breaker mode.

Play is either player vs computer, as either the home or visiting team, two players, or computer vs computer. Password saves allowing resuming the multi-game modes. Included is the ability to edit the teams; you can transfer players between teams to keep the rosters current, or just have some fun. Finally, the Game Breaker mode allows setting up a game in progress using any team, any inning, any score.</desc>

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story.

		<name>Pyramid Magic III</name>
		<desc>Pyramid Magic III is the final title in the Pyramid Magic series of puzzle adventure games, and picks up right where the second game left off. Our hero is still inside of the same pyramid, but is finally nearing the treasure he seeks! Unfortunately, it would appear that the final step requires a large, heavy, fragile jug filled with some kind of liquid. He must now find a way to take this jug to where his treasure awaits.

While the basic concept remains the same, the game is made more difficult by the addition of the jug. The jug is fragile: if it is kicked or dropped any distance, it will break and the stage must be restarted. However, it is also dangerous: much like the stone blocks, if the explorer falls even one square while carrying it, he will be crushed by its weight. In each puzzle, the player must collect all of the keys to open the door, but he must also reach the door while carrying the jug with him in order to proceed. There are a total of 30 puzzles to solve, and once again the player is allowed to "pass" twice.</desc>

		<name>Shove It! ...The Warehouse Game</name>
		<desc>Shove It! The Warehouse Game is a top-down puzzle game based on the original gameplay of Soko-Ban Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.

The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.

The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</desc>

Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.</desc>

		<name>The Ottifants</name>
		<desc>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. 

Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.</desc>

		<name>Langrisser II</name>
		<desc>"Langrisser II" is a sequel to  Warsong (whose original title is Langrisser). The events of the game take place several years after those described in "Warsong". Gone is the benevolent kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the Rayguard Empire, led by Emperor Bernhart and his four generals. Recently, Bernhart ordered his army to attack the neighboring countries, obviously searching for something. This "something" might be none else but a legendary evil sword, that makes the one who wields undefeated. It is up to the noble knight Elwin and his friends to stop the Emperor!

"Langrisser II" is a strategy RPG. The army is divided into soldier units and generals, who fight alone and who are usually stronger than a whole unit. Before the scenario begins, you must hire soldiers, buy weapons and items, etc. During the battle, if you come into contact with an enemy unit, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also cast healing spells on your units or offensive spells to hurt the enemy.

The major difference between "Langrisser II" and its "remake",  Der Langrisser for SNES, is the absence of branching storyline in Genesis release.</desc>

Mowgli is an athletic individual, and can jump, run, swing on vines or climb them without any problems. Most of the animals he comes upon, however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons, such as bananas and boomerangs. 

To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a number of crystals (how many - it depends on the difficulty levels) within a time limit. A compass in the corner of the screen helps him by showing the direction where the nearest crystal is.</desc>

		<name>Wonder Boy III : Monster Lair</name>
		<desc>Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.

In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. 

In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.

If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.</desc>

		<desc>The premise of Flicky is dramatically simple: the chick has to face a succession of fixed boards (which form an infinite loop around themselves) full of platforms. The other inhabitants of the board are a variable number of tiny chicks, a kitten called Tiger and an iguana called Iggy. The objective is of course to collect all the chicks and get them to the exit while avoiding Tiger and Iggy. Once taken under your wing, the chicks will follow you in single file. If Tiger or Iggy manage to hit one of the chicks, it will stop following you and you will have to retrieve it. If the two predators catch Flicky, they eat him, simple as that. The only way Flicky can get rid of his feline and reptilian pursuers is by picking up certain items lying around the levels and sending them into Tiger's vibrissae or Iggy's scales.</desc>

		<name>Super Hydlide</name>
		<desc>A long time ago, evil descended upon the peaceful people of Hydlide. Old legends tell of a lone brave hero who saved Hydlide from the imminent threat of doom - the evil demon Varalys. Since then, the people of Hydlide have lived through centuries of peace. But one dark evening, a huge column of fire exploded out of the depths of Hydlide. The next morning, strange doors began to appear from nowhere. Many who were curious entered these doors, but were never seen again. From that day on, unusual events and disasters began to take place. Huge cracks opened in the ground, scarring the beautiful lands, floods wiped out entire villages. And then the monsters came. The Hydlide council feared that the same evil in the legends was back again. A wise old oracle predicted the second coming of evil. He also spoke of a young man who could save Hydlide from the grave danger. This young man is you...

Super Hydlide continues the tradition of action RPGs started with the original Hydlide for NES. You can choose to play as one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, you use melee or long-ranged weapons or cast magic spells in real time. There is an internal clock in the game that makes it necessary for you to sleep periodically to regain your strength. You also have to eat from time to time, otherwise your hit points will gradually decrease.</desc>

		<name>Valis</name>
		<desc>Yuko Asou is an ordinary Japanese teenager with an ordinary life - until one day she is attacked by a monster on the street. Out of nowhere, a sword appears in her hands. She fights the monsters who have suddenly invaded the city, and is summoned to the parallel world known as Vecanti, which is ruled by a cruel tyrant named Rogles, whose actions disrupt the balance of the the worlds. Wielding the legendary Valis sword, Yuko must defeat Rogles and restore the balance.

Valis has the same story and basic genre (platform action) as the  original first game in the  series; however, it is a different game with different locations, regular enemies and bosses, new cut scenes, etc.  Defeating the numerous enemies populating the game world requires precise usage of jumping and ducking abilities, and attack timing. Yuko can jump very high and attack while jumping. Various power-ups are scattered through the game, many of which enhance the performance of Yuko's sword. Acting as a melee weapon in the beginning, it can be customized with power-ups and turn into a medium-range weapon, firing shots at the enemies - with proper power-ups, also in different directions. Boss enemies typically have different attack patterns and require different strategies to defeat them.</desc>

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

		<desc>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another.</desc>

		<path>./Batman - The Video Game (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Batman : The Video Game</name>
		<desc>The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie.

The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.

Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).

Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).</desc>

		<name>Cliffhanger</name>
		<desc>Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. 

Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.

The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon II : The Revenge</name>
		<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.</desc>

However, it is not a particularly realistic interpretation of sumo, playing much like a traditional 1-vs-1 fighting game. There are grabs, throws, and special moves, and the player can also win by knockout by draining the opponent's stamina. There is a single-player mode that follows the story of protagonist Harimanada, as well as a versus mode for one or two players where any of 15 characters can be used.</desc>

		<name>George Foreman's KO Boxing</name>
		<desc>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</desc>

Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds &#8211; such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.

However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.

In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.</desc>

Their last job saw them saving the Crown Prince Denka from the evil military mastermind Don Morguestein, presumably ending his evil plans. However, three days later, Morguestein has returned once more to take revenge upon the Trouble Shooters. Mania and Maria, never wanting to miss out on the action, head off to take care of him once and for all.

Battle Mania Daiginjo is a comical anime-themed scrolling shooter, and the sequel to Trouble Shooter. The player controls the Dirty Pair-esque Mania and Maria simultaneously, with Maria following closely behind Mania, and also able to turn around and fire to the rear. Unlike most shooters, Mania has a health meter which can be replenished via pickups. There are a variety of weapons to choose from at the start of each stage, and during the game, weapons can be powered up. There is also a screen-clearing bomb attack, but it must be allowed to charge back up each time it is used.

The game includes a standard single-player mode with three difficulty settings. There is also a score attack mode which challenges the player to earn the most points possible in two minutes on a set stage.</desc>

Shadowrun was based on the FASA RPG of the same name, and while real-time, modeled every rule from the paper system, from character stats to experience to combat to weapons and equipment.

The game used an overhead view for physical combat, and a third person "POV" when on Matrix runs. It allowed two other characters to join your party either temporarily or "for life" however long that may be...</desc>

Two small dinosaurs with very large hammers, Charlie and Smiley, make their way through numerous screens of platforms and ladders filled with enemies. Their only method of attack is to bash a hole in the ground, wait for an enemy to fall into it, and then bash the enemy in the head, which causes the enemy to fall and transform into items and delicious food.

There are five worlds, each with several screens and large boss at the end, as well as a minigame between worlds where bonus items can be earned. The game can be played alone or two-player cooperatively.</desc>

The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).

The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.

The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.</desc>

		<name>Curse</name>
		<desc>Curse is a basic horizontal-scrolling shooter, one of the first released for the Megadrive, where one pilots a space fighter through deadly environments such as a mutated jungle, a ruined city, and an underground volcano. The game features five stages, and at several points in each stage, a larger boss enemy appears which must be destroyed to continue.

There a variety of weapon power-ups to collect, each with three power levels. There is a spread shot that can cover nearly the entire screen, a bomb that explodes into shrapnel when it connects, and a twisting wide shot that can pass through environmental obstacles. There are also homing missiles, smart bombs, speed-ups, and an option that can be placed on any side of the ship. The ship also has a shield which can absorb damage from smaller bullets, meaning it can take a few hits before exploding unless it's hit by an enemy ship, part of the landscape or some special enemy weapons that just ignore the shield.</desc>

		<name>The Smurfs Travel the World</name>
		<desc>Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive Smurf brings Smurfette along to Papa Smurfs' laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows them to travel to anywhere in the world, but suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! Now they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards of the Crystal and return home.

A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages there's a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up is awarded.</desc>

		<name>Greatest Heavyweights</name>
		<desc>Greatest Heavyweights is a boxing game featuring the ex heavyweight champions Evander Holyfield, Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali, Floyd Patterson, Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey. Their likeness and real fighting style are simulated by the game.

The game is an enhanced version of Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing, being also played in a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. This time, a 2.5D camera is shown at the top of the screen.

There are three game modes:

1. Exhibition: one or two players can fight a single match.

2. Tournament: one player chooses among the eight heavyweight champs available in a eight-man tournament against the remaining seven.

3. Career: one player creates a character who starts as the #30 of the ranking, fighting his way up against fictional characters. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's color of skin (which now includes some unnatural colors such as green and blue), trunks and hair, haircut, size of body and stats emphasis (power, speed and stamina). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats. After reaching the #1 in the ranking, the player will be challenged by each one of the eight greatest heavyweight champions.

During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks, fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their sides.

Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their opponents. Each one of the heavyweight champions has his own set of personal taunts. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching each other on a regular basis.

The game plays sensibly faster than Evander Holyfield's, and the character animation is more detailed. There's a replay feature included, and the fights are announced by Michael Buffer's voice.</desc>

		<name>Rings of Power</name>
		<desc>For a long time, our world was in darkness. The sun shone as always, but our souls were dark and lacked the true enlightenment. Then the holy Nexus arrived, and changed everything. With his Rod of Creation, he blessed the people with the gift of the six Arts. The Red Priests - the people he chose among the others - established an order of the six Guilds. The world entered the era of prosperity. But the evil demon Void stole the Rod of Creation and drove the world to chaos again. In a cosmic battle, Nexus faced Void. None was victorious, and the Rod of Power was broken during the battle. It was divided into eleven rings, known as the Rings of Power. The young sorcerer Buc is now sent on a quest to retrieve those rings, and to unite the Rod of Power that will eventually banish Void forever!

"Rings of Power" is quite different from traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise, and is more similar to Western-style games such as  Ultima series. You can freely wander through the huge isometric world, and are not obliged to follow any storyline except the main quest for the eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs about many topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. There is a day/night cycle which affects the behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there are no weapons and armor in this game. The turn-based combat is entirely dependent on magic spells. On your journey you will encounter characters from several guilds, each proficient in his own type of magic, and make them join your party.</desc>

		<desc>This game is one of the eight text adventures that chronicles the lives of characters before their story continues in Phantasy Star II. This particular game covers Anna Zirski, a counter-hunter. A counter-hunter hunts down and arrests hunters who have become criminals. Anna is tasked with capturing criminals holed up in a Motavian town. These criminals are accused of illegally accessing Mother Brain in order to disrupt the food production of that region. Anna must put a stop to these hackers.

Gameplay consists of exploring various locations, looking around them to find other characters to converse with in order to gain clues, and searching for items to take in order to use them to solve problems which helps further the plot. 

Some items that can be picked up can be used for weapons during combat. When in combat, the players weapon's attack power is multiplied by a random dice roll to figure out the strength of the attack. The same rule applies to the enemy combatant's attack. The goal of combat is to drain all the enemy's HP.</desc>

		<desc>An ancient evil has resurfaced after being sealed underground for thousands of years. The peaceful island, Usonto, has been split into seven pieces, and it's up to our hero, Hat, and his friends to restore the island and defeat the evil king!

Based on the 1989 TV anime Magical Hat, produced by Studio Pierrot and based on the original manga by Yoji Katakura, Magical Hat no Buttobi Turbo! Daiboken (Magical Hat's Flying Turbo! Adventure) is an action platform game not unlike the Master System classic Psycho Fox. You play as the titular Hat, jumping on and punching enemies, grabbing items from statues, and fighting a boss at the end of each world. In each stage, you can find your robot-egg friend Robegg hidden somewhere, who will help you out by acting as a projectile and a shield.

There are a wide range of different power-up items that can be obtained in the game, which will do things like give you temporary invincibility, freeze all the enemies for a short time, give you an extra-high jump, or even call in air support from a helicopter. At the end of each stage, you can play a game of chance to win extra items and lives.

A heavily modified version of the game was released outside of Japan as DEcapAttack. The graphics, sound, story, and many of the stages were changed.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</desc>

Ten wrestlers with different fighting styles and individual special attacks are available. They are controlled with three buttons; one for jumping, one for attacking and one for pinning. When close to your opponents, you can grab them to perform various moves ranging from ordinary attacks to body slams to throws. Since the action takes place in a ring, it is also possible to climb the turnbuckle or use the ropes to your advantage. You can also leave the ring for a limited amount of time to fight with different weapons that can be found outside the ring.

Apart from a standard Single Match mode, the SNES version also features a Battle Royal mode for up to four players. This mode is not available in the Genesis version, which features a Death Match mode that can not be found in the SNES version. A Death Match is a no rules match in which weapons can be used used and the rope is replaced with barbed wire.</desc>

The graphics have been redrawn to take advantage of the more powerful hardware and the Yohko Ishino tie-in has been removed.

		<name>Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing</name>
		<desc>Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, as the name implies, is a boxing game featuring the three-time World Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D sprite-drawn boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called "FreeCam" 3D system), with the boxers moving around the ring in 360&#176;.

One or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length (up to 5 minutes), the number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O. and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There are two game modes: exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two players) and the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali himself.

There are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the d-pad moves the boxer around, while the A button is used for jabs, the B button for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides which of the boxer's arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode, the d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or C button (for the right arm), the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by pressing left) and body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up (by pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway right (by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an uppercut.

Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get hurt, the bars decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself a boxer can regain power or speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at each side of the screen. If the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those numbers alone, regardless of how many times the fighters were taken down during the fight.

The game features digitized speech, including samples of Ali's voice.</desc>

		<name>Olympic Summer Games</name>
		<desc>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.

Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. 

Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.

The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.

Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</desc>

		<name>Sonic The Hedgehog</name>
		<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends and trapped them inside robots. Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds and Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."</desc>

		<name>Sampras Tennis 96</name>
		<desc>The Europe-only sequel to Pete Sampras Tennis, Pete Sampras Tennis '96 includes new features, such as a reworked graphics engine with parallax scrolling, new shots and aftertouch controls, with an Indoor court joins the previously available Grass, Clay and Hard courts. 

Changes to the game go well beyond the graphics - now the ball reacts differently in each court and it's harder to control the direction of the ball, meaning the powerful forehands that could win a game in minutes of the first game are much harder to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted in both power, direction and timing, facing the risk of hitting the net or going off bounds, with a speedometer showing how fast the best serves went. All these are controlled using the three buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing shots and C to dive for a direction. By combining the B and A or C buttons it's possible to add top/back or full spin to the ball, with the  Y axis changing the power and the X axis the direction. 

The large roster of Pete Sampras Tennis was replaced by only eight players: Pete Sampras himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best suited for hard courts), Marie Guyennot (French, accurate and fast around the court), Minori Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an aggressive style of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), Esperanza Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and volleying abilities) and Richard Potter (English, rookie all-arounder).  There are three game modes to square things up - Challenge (single match, pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament ("Party mode" for up to eight players) and World Tour (single player mode, where the player squares against seven computer players, with the option to play singles or doubles. There's a Pro mode which extend the match to three sets and increase the difficulty setting by enhancing  computer player AI and allowing them to perform spin shots).</desc>

The game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars around a beginner, intermediate, or expert track, competing against a second player or computer drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game controls are very "arcadey" and players can see the leap they made from here to Daytona.

The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is of note as it is the only game for the system which features the SVP chip (Sega Virtua Processor). The chip is a 3D processor built into each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D capability) and is very similar to the SNES's SuperFX chips, used in games such as Starfox and Stunt Race FX.</desc>

		<name>Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel</name>
		<desc>One day, Zero, the side-kick of the evil Edgar Ektor, receives a letter from his girlfriend Amy, which informs him of a lumberjack named Jacques Le Sheets chopping down trees and destroying his homeland for financial purposes. Despite Ektor's protestations, Zero decides that the desire to protect his land is more important that whatever villainous plans his boss might have had in mind. It's time to show that lumberjack that squirrels of dubious reputation are no strangers to the battle for environmental protection!

Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel is a spin-off of the Aero the Acrobat games, its main protagonist being one of Aero's antagonists. The gameplay is similar to that of Aero the Acrobat games, involving fast-paced side-scrolling and platforming action. Zero can eliminate his enemies by executing his trademark Kamikaze Slam: spinning in the air and crushing the unlucky adversary. He can also collect shurikens (shooting stars) scattered across the levels, and use them for projectile attacks. The squirrel is able to perform double jumps to reach high platforms and jump over larger chasms.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition</name>
		<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

		<name>Mamono Hunter Youko : Dai 7 no Keishou</name>
		<desc>From NCS (the makers of Assault Suit Leynos, Assault Suit Valken, Gynoug, and Shubibinman) comes Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho (or Devil Hunter Yoko: The Seven Bells), one of the only games based on the anime/manga devil slayer of the same name. Devil Hunter Yoko is about Yoko Mano, who was a regular girl making her way through high school--until she learned that she is the 108th successor to a line of warriors charged with defending the earth against demons. 

Every woman born into the Mano family has taken up the role of the legendary Devil Hunters, warriors who battle demons and other forces of darkness who threaten Earth. The realm of the demons (which is parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional alignment with our own, which could cause a portal to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and launch an all-out attack. The demons are trying to destroy Yoko before she can take her rightful place as the 108th generation Devil Hunter. She must stop the demons before they can perform the ritual that will mean the end of the human race.

Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho is a side scrolling action/platformer game along the lines of Valis. You control Yoko who is equipped with a sword, which you use to slash your enemies. Also if you hold the attack button you can create a shield which will block weak attacks. The shield can also then be thrown to attack enemies. You play through various different worlds, such as a plant type stage, a water stage, a cave stage, a snow stage, etc.</desc>

The four stages all follow a similar pattern: the first part is from a perspective behind your helicopter where you not only have to dodge enemy fire but also obstacles like buildings or caves. In between, face off against one or two smaller boss enemies. When the first part of a level is finished, the view switches to an overhead perspective for the confrontation with the level end boss.</desc>

Using a top-down view, you race on different scaled-down tracks such as a pond, a kitchen table, a workbench, in the garden, .... The theme is reflected in the vehicles (helicopters, speedboats, tanks, supply trucks...), as well as in the music.

Up to 16 players can participate through the hot-seat party mode, but 8 racers can race simultaneously using the J-Cart and by sharing a part of the joypad. There are different game types, such as regular races (challenges), time trials, and battle arenas, in which you have to survive for a set amount of time while enemy vehicles charge. Other players can be shot to slow them down.</desc>

		<path>./Lawnmower Man, The (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>The Lawnmower Man</name>
		<desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the 35 included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star. There is no scenario mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players.

The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which is a specific type of terrain. Each player controls a number of units, which each take up one space on the grid. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses toward other units, which are also affected by the terrain. Each player controls a capital, and the goal is to capture the other players' capitals.</desc>

		<desc>Dungeon &amp; Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun is set in the world of Mystara, a setting of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. The characters find themselves in a strange, red-hued world in which the horizon slopes upward in all directions, eventually vanishing into a crimson haze at the limits of sight. Their mission is to find and make allies in this new world or else the kingdom and its culture will perish.

The player leads a party of four characters (either the default party or one that the player has created). Characters and races can be chosen from the normal D&amp;D options. The gameworld is viewed from an isometric perspective and the characters can roam around in realtime. Battles are turn based. Like most role-playing games, the gaming experience focuses on exploration, inventory management and character development.</desc>

		<path>./Evander Holyfield's 'Real Deal' Boxing (World).zip</path>
		<name>Evander Holyfield's 'Real Deal' Boxing</name>
		<desc>Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing is a boxing simulation.  Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. The game is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handle by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown at the top of the screen.

Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 30-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's color of skin, trunks and hair, haircut, dominant hand and stats emphasis. Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.

During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks, fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their sides.

Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their opponents. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching each other on a regular basis.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons : Bart vs. the Space Mutants</name>
		<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</desc>

Mado Monogatari I is a puzzle/RPG mixture. Featuring characters and puzzles from Puyo Puyo games, it is set in a 3D dungeon which you explore from first-person perspective. Combat takes place on a platform, and is a mixture of turn-based and real time styles. Enemies attack you even if you wait, but you have time to perform your moves. You should hold down buttons and press direction arrows to execute various magic spells.</desc>

		<name>Ghouls'n Ghosts</name>
		<desc>Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess' castle and her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams.

Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.

Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.</desc>

		<path>./Rise of the Robots (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Rise of the Robots</name>
		<desc>Rise of the Robots is a 2.5D fighting game. You play as the cyborg Eco35-2, half-man half-robot, created by the Electrocorp company, in order to counter the mutiny that is brewing in their Metropolis 4 factory, following the reprogramming of certain robots by injecting them with the EGO virus, making them aware of their situation and therefore aggressive. You will have to fight them one by one in duel battles to stop this rebellion.
The title was intended to be graphically revolutionary. But although the fighting robots are quite nice (with 3D sprites transcribed in a 2D universe), the scenery is only in dull static 2D. Also, the in-game animation is slow, even quite "heavy", directly impacting the handling. 
The slowness of your robot and the varying power of the enemies (to the point that some robots are ultra powerful and atomize you in two shots) quickly make the fights unbalanced.</desc>

		<desc>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</desc>

But during the marriage ceremony, a strange creature appears and kidnaps the bride. Were those the legendary Layans who kidnapped the princess? Whatever the answer might be, Rhys has to find it out on his own. He must find his beloved one...

This game takes us back to a medieval setting. The battle system is similar to that of its predecessor  Phantasy Star II: you can perform simple attacks and special techniques, which require TP (technique points), in a turn-based combat with random enemy encounters.</desc>

		<desc>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.

The version released in Japan has English text and adds trackball support, more difficulty levels, and music closer to the arcade original.</desc>

		<name>World Trophy Soccer</name>
		<desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>

Since his partner is away, Bonkers decides that would be the best opportunity to grab the first prize. In order to win the contest, Bonkers has to catch four famous criminals.

Catching each one of the criminals is a separate mini-game. The first one involves you running horizontally in a museum room and throwing doughnuts at thieves who are trying to steal valuable things. In the second one, you try to lock a criminal in a yard by quickly building a brick wall around him. In the third one, you must find clothes hidden in crates before a bomb explodes. Finally, the fourth and last game involves you driving a car from top-down view, chasing a criminal. Each mini-game also features a unique bonus game, which you get when you successfully complete three games with gradually advancing difficulty in a row.</desc>

		<desc>While cleaning up Acme Looniversity, Buster discovers a map leading to a secret treasure!  But Montana Max swipes the map, and goes after the treasure himself.  He also gets Dr. Gene Splicer to brainwash most of Buster's friends, and kidnaps the rest of them!  Buster has to reclaim his map, his treasure, and save everyone while he's at it!

Buster's Hidden Treasure is a platform game starring Buster and many other Tiny Toons characters.  As Buster, players run through each level, jumping on enemies to defeat them.  Buster can also pick up carrots - for every fifty he collects, he gets a helper friend which can be used to destroy all enemies on the screen.  Although Buster only starts the game with three hearts, his health meter can be increased by collecting bells.

The goal of each level is to find Gogo Dodo, who will let Buster exit the level.  Similar to Super Mario World, Buster's Hidden Treasure has a world map that you can select your level from.  Also similar to Mario World, some levels contain hidden exits, creating shortcuts, or granting players access to tougher levels.</desc>

		<desc>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. 

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</desc>

		<desc>The Franco family used to be one of the influential houses of Portugal. That is until the head of the family sailed out of a disastrous voyage to find the kingdom of Prester John. The disarray that followed brought about an end to the nobility of the Franco name. 100 years have passed and Portugal has prospered through it's sailing and trading empires. Young Leon Fanco wishes to restore his family's good name and make a name for himself as a sailor. At the heart of his ambition is the fair lady, Christiana, who is desired by the likely heir to the kingdom. Towards that end, Leon has been working hard to secure finances for his first ship. With the first step of his dream complete, Franco sails out with his father's good friend as first mate, you're off to find fame, adventure and fortunes out on the sea and in uncharted waters.

Uncharted Waters is a sailing and trading simulation. Your goal is initially to sail between ports and trade goods between them to make a profit. Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.

All of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies.

		<name>Dragon Ball Z : Buyuu Retsuden</name>
		<desc>Dragon Ball Z: Buyuu Retsuden (Dragon Ball Z: The Call of Destiny), also released in France as Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel du Destin, is a fighting game that maintains the dual screen mode previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the opponent yet still be able to see him by having the screen split between the two characters. This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.

The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, "normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").</desc>

They can't see you so your only means of scaring them is by possessing various objects throughout the household.  For example, possessing a piece of furniture would cause something to fly out from it and possessing an object would make it come alive in some way or another.  You need to act quickly because you have something called "ecto" which acts as the fuel that allows you to roam the real world.  You're awarded more ecto each time a family member exists the room.  The more scares you did, the more ecto you gain.  Losing all ecto sends you to the underworld where you have to regain your ecto to full capacity in order to go back into the real world.</desc>

It still has the standard set of modes such as Exhibition, Tournament and Season and updated rosters for the top schools of the time, reflecting the 1994 season.  There are 32 teams with five added ones to this version (Wisconsin, North Carolina, Colorado State, Oregon and Washington State), however to add these schools five others were taken out that were in the previous game (San Diego State, Pitt, LSU, Arkansas and Houston).  It also keeps track of 19 different stats along with authentic offensive and defensive plays attributed to each team.

It also features a battery backup to keep track of stats and save games along with the ability to let four different players compete utilizing multi-tap.  There are also new sound effects added to this version with the announcer from the previous version removed from this one.</desc>

		<name>Lotus II : R.E.C.S</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.

You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint.  Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.

You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. 

You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.</desc>

		<name>Shadow Blasters</name>
		<desc>Humans on Earth have lost their righteous ways. After seeing that this has happened, the Gods have decided to abandon the Earthlings and no longer protect them. Ashura, the King of an alien race hailing from the Evil World, decides that this is the perfect time to strike the vulnerable unprotected Earth.  It just so happens that one of the good gods, Hyperion, takes pity on the humans and decides to bestow his power to four of the strongest Earth warriors so they can go and defeat Ashura and his minions.

The player takes control of these four warriors who are Leo, a fencer, Marco, a monk, and Horatio and Tiffany, whom are both ninjas (one male, one female). Each character fires their own type of weapon and each character can charge up their weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the characters also have a special weapon that can clear all the enemies on the screen but with the caveat that it can only be used once per stage. Each character also has a jump and speed attribute which when powered up allows them to jump higher and walk faster. Players can switch between all of the characters during a stage.

The game has 9 different stages. The player can play the first six (mountain,harbor,street,future,glen, and forest) in any order. Each round ends with a boss which must be defeated to clear that round.</desc>

		<desc>1997 edition of EA's NHL sport simulation series. Improvements in this edition come mostly in the graphical arena, with a refined version of the "virtual stadium" system that adds new camera angles (including the classical top-down one strangely missing from NHL 96), and polygonal players instead of the bitmap-based ones with motion-captured animations.

Other extras include multiplayer support for up to 8 players through network or Gravis's GrIP system, the option to create new players and trade them around, and the usual amount of EA sports licensed multimedia flair, including an interesting "Goalie Mask Viewer" which lets you observe the elaboratedly decorated helmets of 30 goalies.</desc>

		<name>Ranger X</name>
		<desc>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.

The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.

The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</desc>

Or not, as this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. 

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn&#8217;t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points  especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</desc>

		<name>Shadow Dancer : The Secret of Shinobi</name>
		<desc>A.D. 1997, New York City

Having vanquished the evil crime empire, Neo Zeed, the ninja master Shinobi and his combat ninja skills were not heard from for some time. But a new threat arose, in a reptilian form that lived on vicious instinct alone. The colossal monster moved slowly and quietly, and its attack was relentless. The souls unfortunate enough to survive became hostages, and mass panic swept the streets.

It remained only for Shinobi to take action. His weapons were stealth and quickness of attack, his only allies facing overwhelming forces. Relying on Ninja weapons and magic, Shinobi fought on, assisted by his faithful dog.

Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi is similar to Shadow Dancer for home computers, and consists of five missions containing three stages each. However, there are a few differences between the two. For example, in this Sega Genesis/Mega Drive exclusive, the stages are different, and you rescue hostages rather than disarm bombs.  Each mission ends up with you fighting a boss, and when you defeat each (except the final one), you also participate in a bonus stage where you must shoot all ninja flying towards you.

Some of the enemies are also quite different. Some of the lizards, which appear in later missions,  leave a "lizard coin", which you can collect for bonus lives.</desc>

		<desc>Before marketing fat-reducing grills, boxing legend George Foreman endorsed this boxing game with a 3rd-person view similar to Punch Out. A full range of punches and jabs are available, with full round-by-round scoring from the judges. You can choose from 3-12 rounds, and there are 2 camera views as well as an automatic switch option.

You can play simple exhibition matches or tournaments, or launch into a career mode. In this you start at the bottom of the world rankings, and must reach the top by beating the game's players, who other than George are all fictitious boxers with varying strengths and weaknesses. The coach gives advice before each fight to help highlight weaknesses in your play. There are passwords for each round.</desc>

1. Bruno's Deli: The player takes control of Huckle the Cat as they help Bruno serve his customers by selecting the items they have requested on a conveyor belt.

2. Captain Salty: The player uses Huckle again and uses a crane to piece together Salty's ship by dropping them in the required spot which is marked.

3. Building House: This is essentially the same as Captain Salty's stage, except this time around the player is building a house instead of a ship.

4. Delivery Truck: The player uses Huckle and Lowly Worm to deliver various objects to their required shops while avoiding various obstacles such as trashcans, crossing chickens and chairs to name a few.

5. Fire Station: This time the player takes control of a pig fire fighter and transverse BusyTown in a fire truck, collecting various firefighter-related objects while avoiding obstacles.  After each object is collected, the player is then taken to a house fire where they must put out the fire and rescue the trapped animals inside.

6. The Wind: The player can become the wind and shown a top-down map of BusyTown and using a whirlwind can interact with various objects on the screen to view animations.

One or two players choose from four different drivers, each with their own special ability, then head out for a race on one of four different tracks. Of course, the goal is to be the first to finish three laps of the course, but watch out for your opponents; bump into them or the terrain and your vehicle will take damage. Take too much damage and it's game over! After each race, winnings can be used to upgrade or repair the vehicle. There are three difficulty levels, which affect how quickly the vehicle takes damage. There is also a practice mode where the player can freely choose any track.</desc>

		<name>Last Battle</name>
		<desc>Last Battle (known in Japan as Fist of the North Star: Legend of the New Era Savior) is a 2D side-scrolling brawler developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis on July 1, 1989 (in Japan) and August 14, 1989 (in North America as a launch title).

Set in the war-torn future, players take on the role of wandering Jet-Kwon-Do fighter Aarzak as he fights to reclaim his homeland from the empire of the evil Duke, only to journey to the land of the unknown to rescue one of his traveling companions, Alyssa, from three seemingly-invincible rebel generals (Gromm, Gross, and Garokk).

The original Japanese version of the game is the sequel to the 1986 Sega Master System brawler Fist of the North Star (based on the post-apocalyptic martial arts manga and anime of the same name) and details the events of the second anime series (itself the last half of the manga series). Like its predecessor, the international version of the game was localized to remove both the series's trademark extreme violence and all direct references to the source material (though its post-apocalyptic setting and plot elements remained).</desc>

But his wife's father is murdered by a local gangster named Big Boy Caprice, and Dick Tracy is now out for revenge. The game doesn't follow the exact plot of the movie, but simply lets Dick Tracy fight his way through several levels until he faces his archenemy.

This is a platform shooter/"beat-'em-up" game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can't approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</desc>

One day in Antarctica, an asteroid crashes into the crystal that protects the penguins, shattering it into many pieces and freeing the Sno-Bees who had been frozen in ice. In order to rescue his people, the blue penguin (along with a pink penguin in two-player mode) goes after the Sno-Bees and to recover the missing pieces of the crystal. The game takes the basic template of the 1982 original and expands on it, offering a greater variety of enemies, various environmental hazards, and power-ups, along with of course updated 16-bit graphics and sound. The goal is still to push blocks and crush enemies. Enemies now appear from generators, which must be destroyed to stop new enemies from appearing, and all enemies must then be eliminated to complete each stage.

In addition to the main story mode, the game also features a competitive battle mode for up to four players, as well as a conversion of the original arcade game.</desc>

Based on the first two games in the series, in each scenario the player must use the resources at hand to build a railroad connecting from one end of a map to the other. During the day, the titular "A-Train" can be controlled, by which the player can build tracks and stations. During the night, train schedules can be modified. As the player builds, development will spring up around the tracks and stations, bringing in income by which more tracks and stations can be built.

The game offers a total of five different scenarios of increasing difficulty, ranging from a practice scenario for beginners to very difficult scenarios for experienced players. There are also three different game speed settings available.</desc>

		<name>Road Rash 3</name>
		<desc>Following the previous two Road Rash games, the player has conquered the US illegal motorcycle championship. But why settle for that when one can take over the World; racing in the peaceful streets of the UK, dodging the animals in Kenya, blaze through the night in Japan or jump in the hilly circuits in Italy?

Keeping the same spirit of the previous two games, Road Rash 3 adds all new digitized sprites (based on the 32-bit remake released an year earlier), bike upgrades, more weapons and meaner police. Most other aspects of the game remain unchanged: the player starts on the lowest division with a small amount of cash and a slow, hard to handle bike. To get more money (and get a faster bike) the player must beat as many of the other 15 racers to the finish line, using all means possible, even kicking and punching them into knockout. By clearing (finishing on the top three spots) all five races on a level, the player advances to the next, where opponents are faster and tougher, the police is more active and a longer race.

As for new gameplay elements in the final title in the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, bikes can also be improved by choosing cheaper upgrades (instead of simply buying new ones) such as tires (less skidding), engine (improves acceleration and top speed), suspension (allows better control while landing after jumps) and body (bike takes more hits before turning into smoking metal). Instead on relying on simple motorbike patrols, the police now has helicopters at their disposal (which try to land on the player) and patrol cars, which attempt to block the path of the bike, forcing it to stop or collide to get a bust. To make things easier (or harder), new weapons were added, some of which allow the carrier to stun an opponent for a few seconds, making him the perfect victim for an incoming vehicle. Also new, if the player finishes the race with a weapon, carries it to the next race.

Each track has it's own features: in the UK, cars drive left on a rainy day, in Australia and Kenya animals wander into the road, in Brazil bikers can get themselves a close-encounter with a car on a crossing, in Italy the hills allow a lot of air-time for light and speedy bikes, Germany, where the icy roads and sharp turns make a deadly combination and finally in Japan the race goes during the night under the neon lights.</desc>

		<name>SeaQuest DSV</name>
		<desc>Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.

Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.

The vehicles you have at your command include

1. Speeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right
2. Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.
3. Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill
4. Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport
5. Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches
6. Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</desc>

Secret agency Rolling Thunder discovers the organization behind the terror: Geldra. While agents Leila and Albatross are fighting the leader Gimdo (RT2), agent Jay is instructed to bring down Dread, the second-in-command.

There are many improvements to the gameplay: Jay can shoot while jumping and shoot diagonally upwards with certain weapons. At the beginning of each mission, you can pick a special weapon such as a laser rifle, bazooka, flamethrower or grenades. You have to choose carefully as they cannot be reused in later missions. You can still hide in doorways and recharge your weapons behind special doors. The mission timer from the previous game has been replaced by a sniper that targets you with a crosshair when you don't move fast enough. The brutal difficulty from the previous games has been toned down: there are more life marks at the start and you now resurrect where you died, rather than returning to the last checkpoint. Unlike the previous game, you can only choose one character to play with.

After completing a mission, a password is provided to continue playing. There are ten levels in total, with a few hidden areas.</desc>

In each location you have a mission such as retrieve data or capture a terrorist.This usually involves searching around for your goal while dispatching enemies and trying to minimise civilian casualties. The emphasis is on action and weapons, in particular Arnold's favourites: flame thrower and the uzi. He also has a diving roll to help him dodge the enemies bullets and come back guns blazing..</desc>

		<name>Shining Force</name>
		<desc>In a wondrous land perhaps not so far from our world, a strange and terrible series of events took place. The powers of darkness, led by Dark Dragon, fought for control of the world of Rune. Legendary warriors of light fought them with the ancient and modern weapons of the time, and drove Dark Dragon into another dimension. But Dark Dragon vowed that in 1,000 years, he would be able to break through the inter-dimensional barrier, back into this world. 

A thousand years of peace and tranquility passed. The people of the world were happy to live their lives in contentment, able to spend time rediscovering the magical and technological wonders destroyed by Dark Dragon and using them to benefit all people. 

But the kingdom of Runefaust has begun a massive attack of the kingdoms of Rune - intending to help Dark Dragon return to this world! A small band of warriors has been sent out on a dangerous journey to fight against the dark forces of Runefaust, and you are the leader. Prepare yourself for the ultimate battle! 

Shining Force is a strategy/RPG.  As you make your way through the lands of Rune, you will be joined by other warriors who wish to stop the forces of Runefaust.  Each warrior has their own strengths and weaknesses.  As you progress through the game you will also gain new weapons and spells.  Use them wisely to stop Dark Dragon from arising and causing havoc in Rune.</desc>

		<desc>One year after the first edition of the World Fighting Tournament, won by Lau Chan, invitations are sent once again, this time to the second edition of the Tournament. Will Akira's new techniques be enough to beat Wolf? Can Lau defend his title against his daughter Pai? Will Jacky rescue his sister Sarah, who has been brainwashed to kill him? Will Jeffry make enough money to track down the Satan Shark? And Kage, will he uncover if the mysterious Judgement 6 cartel is behind the tournament? All is yet to be seen...

Sharing the name with the second title in Sega's seminal 3D fighter series, this 16-bit version brings the game to the world of 2D fighters.

While the fully polygonal environment of the arcade/saturn version were scratched in favor of regular sprites and side-scrolling camera due to obvious technological constraints (plus  manufacturing costs ruling out the SVP chip used in Virtua Racing) and featuring only the 8 original characters in the series, the rest was directly taken or inspired by it's bigger brother. The arenas are all drawn according to the to the 32-bit titles (and even feature a small parallax scrolling trick to provide a slight 3D illusion), so are the characters, and the also features a lot of the same sound effects and music. Gameplay is also inspired by the original version, with many button combinations remaining unchanged.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin</name>
		<desc>Based on the award-winning TV series, The Adventures of Batman and Robin pits the player against the diabolical Mr. Freeze who wants to free Gotham with a huge ice cannon and his hired help of other Gotham super villains: The Joker, Mad Hatter, and Two-Face. The player can take the role of either Batman or Robin but this choice doesn't make a difference regarding gameplay. 

This is a side-scrolling action game. The player basically walks from left to right while fighting numerous foes in hand-to-hand combat. Weapons which are found during the levels are used to shoot enemies from a greater distance. These weapons can also be upgraded by picking up the corresponding symbols. 

There are overall four areas (one for each villain) with three levels each, including a film studio or the Gotham University. While most stages are typical fighting levels with occasional 3D effects there are also a few flying ones where the player uses the Batwing or a jet pack.</desc>

There are 11 levels to take on, with indoor and outdoor settings. Your character has a range of sword-slashing and jumping moves, which must be used to their full effect if you are to make progress. The game features digitised sound and speech, as well as an action-replay feature, an unusual concept outside sports games at the time.</desc>

		<name>Predator 2</name>
		<desc>Players guide Lt. Mike Harrigan as he tracks the Predator through seven levels based on the film. Mike's primary concerns are the hostages held around the levels, and the legions of gang members out for blood. He also has to contend with the Predator, both as a boss at the end of each level, and as a time limit - if the player takes too long to rescue a hostage, the Predator will blast the hostage with his tri-laser.

The game is played in a third-person isometric view, with great swarms of easily-killed bad guys, who appear through one-way doors scattered throughout the level. Weapons not only include faster machine guns and shotguns, but also a few highly-advanced Predator weapons the player can pick up and use. Each defeated gang member drops drugs that can be picked up and automatically sent off to the "drug squad" for points. No sounds or music from the film get used, but stills scenes from the film do introduce the levels.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat III</name>
		<desc>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</desc>

The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.</desc>

Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</desc>

Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</desc>

		<desc>If anyone is wondering what the AWS in this title means, it is an acronym for Asciiware World Sports. Now with that out of the way, this is a soccer game with training, exhibition, and tournament modes.

Training lets the players team practice without an opposing team on the field. Exhibition is the basic one team versus another for one game. The tournament mode is divided into two different modes; 8 Nations and World Cup. 8 Nations is just a shorter version of the World Cup tournament mode because it involves only 8 teams instead of all 32 of them like it does in the World Cup mode.

The player can choose to play as one of these 32 International teams or can choose to create their own team that has its own shirt, stripe, and shorts colors.

The game has options that allow the player to choose to have light or heavy wind, a dry, soggy, or snowy field, and to have fouls turned on or off.</desc>

		<name>Starflight</name>
		<desc>A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?

Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Once out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.</desc>

		<name>Wonder Boy III : Monster Lair</name>
		<desc>Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.

In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. 

In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.

If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.</desc>

When batting, the D-pad moves around and C swings. When pitching, Left and Right move around and some amount of time holding the C button appears to pitch.</desc>

		<name>FIFA International Soccer</name>
		<desc>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

Max is a kid who possesses a magic cap that allows you to travel across different world and to save people who get in trouble in other dimensions. But his archenemy, the demonic Skull Master, has recently locked all the portals Max was using for inter-dimensional travel. However, the Skull Master has kept some of the portals for himself, keeping there some of his destructive weapons. It's time to destroy those weapons and to stop Skull Master!

This is a platform game in which you control Max himself or one of his two side-kicks (that doesn't influence the gameplay). You travel through several different worlds. Your goal is to find Skull Master's weapons, which are scattered around the level, and to destroy them. The levels are timed, and there are also plenty of enemies who will disturb you on your way to the goal.</desc>

Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling "slots" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</desc>

		<name>Daze Before Christmas</name>
		<desc>Christmas is a time where people get together and give others presents and spend all day eating food. But there's only one problem this year. You see, while Santa was sleeping in his bed, the cold and evil snowman spooked all the elves away, and the Timekeeper has stolen Santa's plans from his house. There won't be any Christmas if Santa doesn't stop them.

In Daze Before Christmas, you're Santa. According to the game's Christmas calender, you have 24 areas to explore such as factories, workshops, caves, and more. Each area is filled with nasty enemies like penguins, jack-in-the-boxes, helicopters, snowmen, and many others. Furthermore, after every five areas, Santa has to come face-to-face with not only The Evil Snowman, The Timekeeper, and Louse the Mouse,  but also Mr. Weather.

Santa's health is represented by five Santa hats. When Santa is hit by any one of his enemies, one hat is lost. If Santa loses all of his hats, then he will lose a life. He will then have to restart at the beginning of the area, unless he passes a gold bell somewhere in the area. When you explore each area, Santa can collect presents that contain a mini-Santa (aka: Extra Life), a red hat, or he may release an elf. Santa should be careful when opening these presents as some of them may contain bombs or other enemies. If Santa manages to find a spinning star, he must get it as this will take him to the next area.

Santa kills his enemies by throwing magic at them. In almost each area, Santa can get a cup of hot cocoa. Doing this will transform him into Anti-Santa, a type of Santa who wears nothing but white, grows Satan's horns on top of his head, is invincible, and comes equipped with a hammer in which he can use to bonk enemies with. The Anti-Santa business only lasts for 20 seconds, but this can be changed via the Options menu.

Daze acts like one of those platform games where you run through the level, shoot at enemies, and proceed to the exit. However, there are some areas where the gameplay changes, and these areas involve Santa flying through the sky in England, Russia, Japan, and the USA, and dropping presents in chimneys to score points. The game also uses a password-saving system, where entering a password given will allow gamers to restart at the beginning of a specific area, in case they happen to run out of lives.</desc>

Thus Taz becomes fascinated and leaves in search of one of those eggs before his Dad has even finished the story...

Taz can Jump, perform a Spinning Jump and a Spin Attack. Munch roast chickens to replenish life. Gain extra points by moving quickly through the levels - there are six stages and each stage has two rounds.

There are a few other items and pickups such as:

1. Spring: boings Taz up to high ledges.
2. Blocks: destructible.
3. 1-UP: extra life.
4. Star: invulnerability. Unless you run into a bomb.
5. Bomb: does what it says on the tin.</desc>

		<name>Grind Stormer</name>
		<desc>This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade game. There are two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.

In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.

The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options. After using a continue, the player immediately receives a "Special" power-up granting four wingmen.</desc>

As mentioned you get to select from 8 differently tuned cars, each with different handling and speed specs. and then ride out in hopes of getting the trophy. At the end of each stage you get to select between different branching routes that determine what your next stage will be, and thus the different routes you take to the end game determine what ending you get (if you manage to beat the other players).

OutRunners places a big emphasis on competitive gameplay as you are always racing against another car, be it an AI or human-controlled one in a perpetual split-screen multiplayer mode.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, even the simple kids game of marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles takes the basic concept of the classic kids game -- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi twist. The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.</desc>

		<name>PGA Tour 96</name>
		<desc>PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).

The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.

Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</desc>

		<name>Ecco the Dolphin</name>
		<desc>Travel through time along with Ecco the dolphin, in the only game that could call itself a "dolphin simulator". Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>

		<desc>Dr. Kal Morrow, expert in genetic research and creation of human-animal hybrids, has been kidnapped and his family brutally murdered by the terrorist organization CHIMERA. His surviving son Saul takes it upon himself to avenge his family. Using his father's research, he turns into a man-wolf and sets out to find CHIMERA's base and defeat their leader Karl Draxx.

As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.</desc>

Vercingetorix, the great leader of the Gauls, was defeated by Julius Caesar, and lost his shield to him. Now it's up to Asterix to recover this shield from the Romans!

In this platform game, you guide Asterix through various levels. You can move on an isometric overview map to access different locations. You can jump, run, and defeat your enemies by spinning and hitting them. There is a variety of items to collect and obstacles to overcome.</desc>

		<name>Jurassic Park</name>
		<desc>This game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</desc>

		<name>Super Skidmarks</name>
		<desc>A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of features, and one of the last multi-format games to have roots on the Amiga.

A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on more powerful machines - with up to 3 different models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering. 

24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.

The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down. Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air. Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time? New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields; the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely), and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you).</desc>

Instead of the usual "save the princess" or "liberate the world" kinds of a plot, "The Flintstones" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.</desc>

		<desc>Scooby-Doo Mystery is a point-and-click (or point-and-press button rather) adventure featuring two playable episodes of a typical scooby-doo cartoon.

Blake's Hotel - Daphne's Uncle Blake has invited the gang over to his hotel for a ski weekend. Upon reaching the hotel they learn that the ghost of the Ancient Chieftan is scaring all the customers away, as he isnt happy about a hotel being built on his burial grounds. Soon Uncle Blake is kidnapped, and its up to Scooby and Shaggy to find clues and hunt this ghost down.

Ha Ha Carnival - The gang arrives at an almost-deserted carvinal, looking for some fun. Soon enough Fred, Daphne and Velma get trapped in a pond when they go out in one of the rides. Not only that, someone has broken the rollercoaster tracks. Then an evil looking phantom clown has  Scooby and Shaggy being chased all around the carnival. Another mystery for the pair to solve.

Both mysteries have Scooby and Shaggy on their own, collecting clues and putting them together. You control Shaggy mostly while Scooby just keeps him company. The game interface involves walking around and/or choosing actions from a menu and using them with objects. A password feature is provided so you can continue where you left off.</desc>

The game is viewed from above and played up and down the pitch, without the left-to-right option of Goal. Matches can be between 2 or 20 minutes, and the scanner which shows player positions on the rest of the pitch can be moved, resized or disabled. The method of triggering aftertouch onto a pass can be chosen as well.

The game features a variety of tournaments, including the full World Cup and its qualifying rounds, and the European Championships, or individual matches, as well as being able to configure a league or cup tournament ot your own specification. Only international teams are included, although their names can be customised. Unlike most soccer games of the time, player ethnicities are accurately depicted.</desc>

Enemies come from all directions, and certain waves will drop powerups, including shields and weapon upgrades. The player needs to collect five upgrades in order to improve their weaponry, but the upgrade affects all three weapons.

The game includes eight stages, most of which include both a midboss and a boss at the end, and three difficulty settings. There is also a minigame similar to Whack-a-Mole where there is a grid of ship icons, and the player must hit the rotating ships.</desc>

		<name>Streets of Rage 2</name>
		<desc>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>

		<name>Gain Ground</name>
		<desc>Gain Ground is an arcade style action game with a bit of strategy thrown in. The goal is get all of the soldiers to the opposite side of the screen or to kill all of the enemies. Each soldier in the army has a unique specialization, from among 20 types. Each soldier can attack in two different ways, using either a normal weapon or a special weapon. The strategy comes from deciding which soldier would do best in which situation. Some weapons are better at dealing with certain enemies and obstacles than other weapons.

Players start with only three soldiers but can encounter other soldiers that can be rescued, by touching them. If the new solider survives long enough to reach the exit, they can be added to the soldier inventory. The number of possible soldier in a player's army is over 30 soldiers. There are 50 stages total, divided into rounds of 10. At the end of each round, players encounter an enemy boss.</desc>

While this is happening, a nearby space station picks up a distress signal. Tinhead, guardian of the edge of the universe, hears the cries for help and hurries to the rescue.

The gameplay is somewhat different than your typical platformer. There is some exploration required to find the exit or if you want to get health or points. You attack your enemies by shooting them with small metal orbs that come out of TinHead's head. You can shoot them in three different directions: diagonal upward, straight, or just let them jump out and bounce over the ground. The direction is chosen by using a specific button.</desc>

		<desc>This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.</desc>

There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. 

You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2016, war has broken out in Africa over mining rights to rare metal. Machines of destruction called "maneuver cepters" have been developed as the primary force, but recently a mysterious maneuver cepter has appeared in the northern territories. It is known by the name of "Granada", and has been destroying the weapons of the factions on both sides. You are this machine's pilot, a man by the name of Leon Todo.

Granada is a free-roaming scrolling shooter. You control the titular maneuver cepter Granada as you make your way through each stage, destroying the enemy's weapons. You have a map that tells you where your targets are on the stage, and once all the targets have been destroyed a large boss enemy appears which must also be destroyed. You are equipped with a standard cannon, as well as a more powerful blaster that will actually push your machine backwards with the recoil. There are also assist pickups which will follow you and reflect any shots you fire at it toward the nearest enemies.

Of special note is the fixed cannon feature. Using this feature, you can hold the direction of fire while still moving freely. The game has nine stages and three difficulty levels.</desc>

Zafan takes the boy into his home, where he grows up, unaware of this story. When he reaches the age of sixteen, Zafan dies, attacked by monsters. He sends his adoptive son to visit the king of the country, to follow the way of the warrior - and perhaps to discover his true origins...

This is a traditional Japanese RPG set in a medieval environment, with randomly appearing enemies whom you fight in turn-based style, viewing the battle field from first-person perspective. During your journey through the country you'll meet other characters who will join your party. There is a night/day cycle in the game.

Not to be confused with the post-apocalyptic RPG Maten Densetsu for SNES.</desc>

		<desc>Flux is a music visualizer software developed by EXP for the Sega Mega Drive and released by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Europe. When the Mega Drive is connected to a Sega Mega-CD, an audio CD is in the CD tray, and this cartridge in the Mega Drive, Flux will have the Mega CD play the music on the CD and show various user-configurable effects (the default being a two-channel oscilloscope). B pauses playback, Left and Right skip tracks, and Start brings up the configuration panel.

The cartridge works for two reasons &#226;&#8364;&#8221; the Mega CD supports using a cartridge as a boot image (this was also done with Wonder Library) and supports having the boot image access the CD drive for audio playback. Kega Fusion can emulate all this specifically for Flux; instructions are in its readme file. It requires a small modification to its configuration file and a European Mega CD BIOS to work.</desc>

		<desc>The second in the series features campaigns in Lybia, the Persian Gulf, The Middle East and Vietnam, making for a total of 250,000 miles of potential action and danger. Primary and secondary aerial and ground-based targets must be destroyed on each of these. You are armed with a cannon, AMRAAM long-range air-to-air missile, Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile, and the Maverick air-to-ground missile.

11 camera angles including internal and external views of the plane exist. To help new players there is a training mode, with options to disable crashes and automate take-off and landing. Enemy AI is responsive, but a targeting computer helps you take them out before they can do it to you. The game incorporates two "Director's Modes" which cuts away from your cockpit to highlight special events occurring elsewhere in the game world, like enemy base launching fighters, SAM sites launching SAMs, and your missiles hitting the target.</desc>

The weapons include a simple gun, glue spots they can leave to trap other cars, homing missile, and others. There are 24 different tracks available in the game.

		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

		<name>Beast Wrestler</name>
		<desc>A one on one fighting game seen from an isometric perspective. All beasts or dragons have two basic attacks: a punch and a tail attack, as well as a special attack that can only be performed while a certain icon is displayed. During close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can also be used to initiate jump attacks.

There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina).  After every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few points in the game, it is possible to splice the player's Dragon's genes which that of a defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.</desc>

		<desc>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>

There are three modes available: GP mode, which lets the player play a 16-race season as their preferred driver; Spot mode, where the player can play a custom race against a full field; and Test mode, where the player can practice to build their skills. The player can adjust their vehicle's engine, tires, brakes, suspension, and spoiler to their tastes between races, and can also play a free run before competing. The game has three GP mode save files, and will also record the best times for each course.</desc>

You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial.

The ground splits open, the oceans boil, and all living things on the planet begin to change...including humanity. Scientists create a computer to leave a seed and restore humanity, a computer known simply as "N", which is part of the top-secret Project Yukiwo. What is Project Yukiwo? None who know remain...

Master of Weapon is a vertically-scrolling shooter based on the 1990 Taito arcade game. The player controls the fighter ship "N", shooting various biological enemies. Powerups are sparse, with only a handful of upgrades available from item pods. The player can fire in the air, as well as towards the ground to hit land-based enemies. There is also a special weapon which can be changed with powerups, but also takes time to recharge back to full stock. There are a total of nine "acts", and three difficulty settings.</desc>

		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

		<desc>Edson Arantes do Nascimento, commonly known to us as football legend Pel&#233;, licensed a second football game, featuring the 24 qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup, each with summaries and tactical advice from Pel&#233;. These can play in either friendly matches or the full tournament. A five-a-side mode is included, taking place on a full-sized field.

The view is isometric, although playing bottom-right to top-left, the opposite of FIFA International Soccer. Weather effects are optional, matches can be between 5 and 45 minutes (in 5-minute increments), and penalty shoot-outs are optional. A full range of formations are available, as well as squads of 22 fictitious players.</desc>

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game.

One day, a mysterious evil panda decides he must have it, and steals it for himself, turning it into his own personal pachinko island, a place where anyone who enters can never leave. Chen is a man who loves pachinko, and one day he heads of to the famous pachinko parlors of Yokohama...and never returns. Fortune tells that very soon, the person who will stop the evils of this pachinko parlor will appear, and Chen's daughter, Ren, sets out on her 18th birthday for Yokohama, looking for her father.

Pachinko Kuunyan is a pachinko RPG much like the Pachio-kun series. The player controls Ren as in a standard role-playing game, but rather than fighting battles, she can enter pachinko halls and play the machines. Each of the five cities has several pachinko halls, and Ren must empty out a certain number of machines before she can move on to the next city. If she runs out of balls, then the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>A terrorist organization led by a fanatic operating out of the Middle East has brought together a military force capable of holding the entire world hostage, backed by a lot of evil governments. The player needs to board a F-119 stealth fighter and stay undetected while taking out all opposition.

Although technically boarding a stealth fighter, no stealth elements are involved. After choosing one from the different locations on the map, the player is shown flying from a first-person cockpit perspective and enemies do not seem to have trouble locating the player's aircraft. In different solo missions the player needs to take out all opposition using regular bullets and lock-on missiles. All statistics, including the remaining time before running out of fuel and the enemies on the radar, are shown in the cockpit HUD. The craft is able to move left and right, and use a boost to do sideways rolls or complete loops to get behind enemies. Some shots can be taken, leading to body damage, but incoming missiles are usually fatal and those need to be shot or avoided. Next to regular enemies, there are also a few boss planes. Missions take place all over the world during different times of day.</desc>

There are various power-ups that improve your fire power. 

In the top down levels you can only travel in cardinal directions and cannot maneuver around obstacles easily or slow down. The control in the side scrolling levels is reminiscent of R-Type or Gradius, but with more basic weapons systems. In future incarnations of the series the top down aspect would be abandoned.</desc>

		<name>Championship Bowling</name>
		<desc>Championship Bowling is a standard bowling game for one or two players, and the only one available for the Genesis. The player picks one of four different bowlers and the ball they want to use, then heads out to the lanes. The player controls the throw, spin, and power by stopping bars at the right time.

The game includes three different play modes: standard bowling; spare mode, where a handful of pins are placed with the goal being to pick up a spare; and bonus mode, where specific pins are worth different amounts of points. Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.

The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</desc>

		<desc>It's the year 300x.  The Earth has been ravaged by careless humans, leaving an uninhabitable, polluted wasteland.  The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren't happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it.  They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.

Why don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves?  It's not exactly clear.

So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.</desc>

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...

Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you're inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.

The game progresses linear through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's progressing.</desc>

		<desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

		<desc>NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, was one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and was also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.

A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an "on fire" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become "on fire" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while "on fire").</desc>

As indicated by the title, the game's main innovation is play-by-play commentary speech unique to what is happening on the field.

Playing options include exhibition games and a league mode. The game features 28 teams and a playbook of more than 50 plays. Players can also create a "dream team" from all the players in the game and save it through a password.

The action is seen in a horizontal view of the field, which switches to a zoomed-in view once the line of scrimmage is crossed. Two players can play either against each other or cooperatively on the same team.</desc>

You and a friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, armed with a water pistol and all manner of gadgets you find along the way in an effort to find your way back out.  The game world is a giant maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of original layout ideas.  Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your "friend" to find and get to an exit first.  Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds (about 6 entries to choose from), games often take several hours to complete.

The basis of the game is exploration, with varying game modes further focusing on competition, puzzle solving, speed, exploration, or cooperation.</desc>

But one day, a creature was created that appeared to be dangerous to the humans themselves. No signal came to the capital city from the experimental labs... You, a nameless young man living in Paleo, Mota's capital, are commanded to go to the labs and check the issue. Your friend Nei, a semi-human girl, goes with you, and other brave adventurers join you on what starts with a simple mission but develops into saving the entire world...

This is the first Phantasy Star game for the Genesis, set in a futuristic world. The turn-based combat allows you to choose between "fight", where the characters simply attack physically for one turn, and "strategy", where you can choose from several sub-commands, to defend, to use a special technique, or to run from the battle. Instead of magic there are "techniques", that require the usage of TP (technique points).</desc>

		<desc>In the future all intergalactic disputes must be settled by a duel to the death. Nine galactic superpowers take control of the flight paths, leaving the Federation unable to operate. To regain the paths, the Federation sends in Barrett Jade inside a giant cyborg. He has to battle to death and defeat the other nine superpowers' contestants to regain control.

Death Duel is a tactical side-scrolling first-person shooter. The game consists of different time-limited rounds against a single enemy. Before each game, the player can spend Pheelae (money) on repairs and determine what weapons to take into battle. Each opponent has specific weaknesses and they can hide behind walls on the battlefield. To take them out, Jade needs to choose the most effective weapons and target specific parts before he runs out of time and ammo.

		<desc>Long time ago, the planet of Darius went into ruin but Proco and Tiat of Darius gave birth to a new planet and named it Orga. After the passing of many centuries, Proco Jr. and Tiat Young receive a strange radio broadcast from the galaxy. They discover the radio broadcast is a mayday signal from another descendent of Darius. They board the Silverhawk, preparing to defeat an evil force and journey to the galaxy.

Darius II, or Sagaia as it is known in the West, is the second installment in Taito's premier shoot 'em up series. Its main distinguishing features are the non-linear level system and the enemies, which are different kinds of seafood.</desc>

		<name>ESWAT : City Under Siege</name>
		<desc>The city is besieged by wanted criminals, and as a police officer it is your duty to stop them. The first criminals in the wanted list can be stopped with your service weapon an some fast reactions, but once you're facing the toughest criminals in town you'll need to use the cyber suit, which provides additional protection and higher firepower.

Unlike other versions of this game, this Genesis cartridge doesn't follow the layout of the arcade game. The levels, rather than being linear, feature some platform elements, and the enemies in the first levels are no longer bank robbers or hit-men, but soldiers and robots instead. And the setting is no longer your typical American city, but a futuristic megalopolis.</desc>

The player can also choose to play against different levels of opponents, whose skills are measured on that opponent's putting, approach, and control abilities. 

The game lets the player choose whether to play on a US or Japanese golf course. Once out on the course, the player must choose which golf club to use, where to make contact with the ball, and where to aim in the direction they want the ball to go. Once that's decided the player fills a swing meter and hits the ball trying to get the ball into the hole.</desc>

		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

		<name>Jewel Master</name>
		<desc>As the peaceful kingdom Mythgard came close to being overthrown by the evil demon king Jardine the Mad, the Elemental Masters of the realm gathered to do battle. They fought Jardine until there was no more than four remaining. The four combined their powers to form the Elemental Blade with which the demon king could be slain. At this time the Jewel Master was summoned to wield the blade, however the blade has been lost and the rings of the elemental masters have been scattered across Mythgard, all save two. The Jewel Master must gather the other ten rings of the Elemental Masters and reclaim the blade and ultimately do battle with the demon king.

The gameplay is based on fighting a lot of monsters in classic arcade platform kind of way. To do this you have at your disposal rings, two which you begin with and further more that you gain along the way. Each ring is of one of the four elements and by combining them you gain different effects. Rings of opposite elements cancel each other but you have to hands and two attack buttons so you can use say water on the one and fire on the other. The rings are also different in strength which further adds some complexity.</desc>

		<name>General Chaos</name>
		<desc>General Chaos is an arcade-style squad RTS where the player controls a team of five soldiers in a limited battleground, in a classic Red (General Havoc, headquarters in Viceria) vs Blue (General Chaos, in Moronica) all out war. The goal of the game is to push the frontline to the enemy headquarters, by winning individual battles and then beat them in their own capital.

There are five kinds of soldiers, each with their weapon of choice and range of attack: the Gunner (machine gun, medium range and wide arc), Launcher (rocket launcher, long range), Chucker (grenades that can be thrown over barricades), Scorcher (flame-thrower, close combat) and Blaster (dynamite sticks, close range). Before each battle, players can choose the composition of their team from one out of four choices: Assault team, Brute Force, Commandos (a team of just two soldiers which have different controls) and Demolition.

Gameplay is simple to learn, with the A button being used to fire at the nearest enemy, B to move to a the pointer location and C to cycle through soldiers. Using the commando team changes the controls, with the directional pad controlling a soldier directly, with B being used to call the other soldier nearby. While basic commands are simple, the player must deal with things such as distance from target and angle of attack to succeed.
If two opposing soldiers face-off during battle, they engage in a brawl (indicated by a cloud of dust). When that happens, the battle stops and the players are in direct control of the soldiers: A punches, B kicks and C blocks. Every downed soldier can can be rescued if there are enough medics available, earned at the end of each battle depending on how well the player did. 

Up to four players can play, cooperatively or against each other.</desc>

		<desc>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</desc>

		<name>Streets of Rage 3</name>
		<desc>Streets of Rage 3 aimed to build on the success of its predecessor, so while the style of gameplay and control scheme is largely identical to its predecessors, significant changes were made to the overall structure of the game. Streets of Rage 3 is a faster paced release with longer levels, a more complex plot (which in turn leads to more in-depth scenarios complete with interactive levels and multiple endings) and the return of traps such as pits. Dash and dodge moves were added to each character's arsenal of moves, and weapons can now only be used for a few times before breaking.

Changes to the fighting mechanics allows for the integration of weapons with certain movesets. Team attacks, absent from Streets of Rage 2 but available in the original Streets of Rage, make a return, and are occasionally used by enemies too. Blitz moves, performed while running, have also been altered and are now upgradable over the course of the game (predicated on how many points are earned per level). Death causes a downgrade, however holding the X button before a series of button combinations can give players access to the upgraded moveset at any point in the game, at the expense of the time taken to perform attacks.

Enemies are also smarter with weapons, and some can even steal health upgrades, and there are also several secret playable characters, unlockable after overcoming certain conditions during the game. Special moves also no longer drain the user's health - a separate, automatically regenerating bar is introduced for this purpose.</desc>

There are three different types of speedways to race on: Super Speedway, Short Track and Road Courses  with 5 different tracks for each to choose from.  Players can choose to race against the computer that has all 23 other stock cars on the track at once or play head-to-head on a split screen against a friend.

It also featured realistic driving physics.  While it didn't have a NASCAR license, it did have ESPN which broadcasted the races and had NASCAR analyst, Dr. Jerry Punch, who lent his voice to the game for the color commentary.</desc>

		<desc>In the early part of the 20th century, a group of evil poachers recklessly hunted animals to the point of extinction, including lions, deers, elephants, eagles, and several others.

Growl is a one-player game, in which you control one of four characters (Gen, Burn, Khan, and Jack) and you must defeat these evil poachers by dealing with them with your fists. However, there are weapons that can be found, including grenades, rocket launchers, whips, swords, guns, and shotguns, which you get once an enemy drops them on the ground, so you can use these weapons against them. If you manage to get one of the guns, you can shoot enemies with a limited supply of ammo. Once the ammo runs out, your only option is to pistol-whip them.

Also, you can pick up crates and barrels and haul it at enemies to knock them down. Along the way, you'll encounter several cases of animal cruelty, such as two men whipping a lion. Stop the animal cruelty, and the animals will help you in your quest to defeat these evil poachers.</desc>

		<desc>This was the first 16-bit baseball cart on the market. Play alone or with a friend. Choose from any of the 26 major league teams. The game uses all of the real-life city names, but the stats and player names are fictional.

Once on the field, game play follows standard baseball rules. The password feature enables you to take your team all the way through a season to the World Series. The game also tracks all of the other teams in the league simultaneously.

Batters in the game are rated according to batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding and throwing ability. Pitchers are rated by ERA, curve-throwing ability, stamina, top throwing speed, and the distance a hit pitch will travel. All the ratings make this game a challenge to your managerial ability as well as your gaming skill because you're calling the shots from the dugout.

The option screen enables you to decide how tough your computer opponent will be. You can play a pitcher's duel, a batter's slug fest, or a normal game. Decide whether there'll be fielding errors and determine how the wind will affect the hit balls. This game covers about every detail, right down to umps who shout "safe" or "out."</desc>

		<desc>MegaMind is a computer version of the classic code-breaking board game Mastermind for one player. The player must guess a four-digit sequence of pieces within a set number of turns; the only feedback given is an indication of how many correct pieces are present and how many correct pieces are both present and in the correct place. There are four difficulty levels, with higher difficulties increasing the number of pieces to choose from as well as allowing the computer to outright lie once during the game. There are four different themed sets of pieces to play with.</desc>

This was the first and one of the very few Genesis / Mega Drive games to be released with a J-Cart, which meant that four-way gameplay was possible without the need for special adapters. The J cartridge had two built-in joypad connectors. The Game Gear version was equally inventive, allowing two players to share one Game Gear, or four players to play doubles by linking two handhelds.</desc>

The game features a basic 3D engine which allows to simulate slopes with ease, which enhances the gameplay of some events such as the Downhill. Gameplay, as expected from a Winter sports game, relies on finding the faster trajectories in most events (Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge and Bobsled), pacing the run correctly (Cross Country and Biathlon), skill and timing (Ski Jump), with button mashing reserved for just one (speed skating). The player (up to ten) can select his (or her) competitor face and nationality from one of 16 possible choices, and by selecting different difficulty settings, different computer controlled athletes take part in the competition along the player.</desc>

While at first not knowing the difference between a slam dunk and a Sherman tank, he slowly becomes an important part of the Shohoku High School team, which fights against the odds on the road towards the regional championships.

Slam Dunk: Kyogo Makko Taiketsu! (Champion Front Showdown!) is a five-on-five basketball game based on the anime and manga created by Takehiko Inoue. Following the story, starting from the first exhibition matches, the player can take control of either a single player or the whole Shohoku team in an arcade-style basketball game. The game uses a side-view for the center court, and zooms in for a head-on view when near the basket. There is also an exhibition mode for up to five players, where six different school teams from the series are available for play.</desc>

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek, The Next Generation : Echoes from the Past</name>
		<desc>The Romulans request permission to enter the Neutral Zone in order to search for a team of their researchers that they claim has gone missing. The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.

Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.

From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set course to a different planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which is only possible if your current mission requires it).

Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.

Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.

While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version as well.</desc>

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</desc>

		<desc>The Genesis title based on Batman Returns is a platform game in which the Dark Knight must traverse five action-filled levels on his way to confront the Penguin.

Areas include the rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the Red Triangle Circus and the sewers. Besides run-and-jump action, there's also a lot of combat in the game, as many of the Penguin's henchmen stand in Batman's way. He can knock them out with punches and kicks and a number of extra weapons stored in his utility belt. These include batarangs, which come in standard and self-seeking varieties, and smoke bombs that stun enemies for a while. In addition, Batman can shoot from his grappling gun and unleash a deadly swarm of bats towards enemies. All of these weapons have limited ammo, however, that must be collected.

Other special tools Batman can use include the grappling hook to reach high places or swing across chasms, and his cape, which can be used to slow falls.

Each of the five levels features several boss battles against Catwoman, the Penguin and others.</desc>

You can either compete in an exhibition mode or play in career mode and become the greatest of all time.

The set of punches in the game is pretty much standard, jab, hook, uppercut, even the ever popular but illegal low blow.  Also, for each round and every knockdown you score on an opponent, you get a super punch, a straight shot to the face and is almost unstoppable and connected right could knock out your opponent, but if you miss, you lose your punch for the round.

There are two main displays during a fight, a damage inflict meter in the form of two boxing gloves, one on each side and as a player connects a punch, the glove will show a black area of where the glove connected and a damage meter that show's the two fighters faces.  As the round progresses, the fighter shows more bruises and cuts and starts to flash red when the fighter is getting tired and is the best time to land your super punch.

Another feature is from round to round, your view will alternate, from looking over your shoulder to the next round and looking at yourself over your opponents shoulder.</desc>

The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with &#8216;up&#8217; referring to &#8216;climb&#8217; or &#8216;dive&#8217;, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. 

Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves &#8211; this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.</desc>

		<name>Shining Force II</name>
		<desc>Shining Force II is a strategy/RPG hybrid with cartoon-like graphics. The game is comprised of two modes: exploration, in which the hero and his companions engage in the role-playing game standard of talking to townspeople, exploring new lands, and furthering the plot; and battle mode, in which the combat is resolved from a tactical point of view, with individual combats being resolved from a close-up view with animated characters.

The plot consists of such quests as saving a princess from the clutches of demons, rebuilding the hero's hometown, and uniting the various forces of good together against the hero's nemesis. Along the way, the hero will be joined by many characters who seek to aid him in his journey. Several of these characters can only be obtained by completing side quests. In addition, random battles can occur between the programmed scenarios, giving the hero's party a chance to obtain experience and gain levels outside of the set scenarios.

		<name>Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball</name>
		<desc>Roger Clemens is known by some as the greatest pitcher in baseball history. In  Roger Clemens MPV Baseball players play a standard a 9 innings baseball game in Exhibition mode and a full regular season can be played including the World Championship Playoffs in the Regular Season mode. While playing in Regular Season mode the player can see their chosen team&#8217;s progress by using the in game calendar showing all the games.

Players select a fictional team from the following groups:

1. National Division West: San Francisco Quakes, Los Angeles Apaches, Cincinnati Big Cats, San Diego Suns, Houston Mustangs, and Atlanta Condors.

2. National Division East: Chicago Swords, Montreal Lumberjacks, New York Buffalos, St. Louis Commandos, Pittsburgh Panthers, and Philadelphia Generals.

3. American Division West: Oakland Bashers, Seattle Pioneers, Minnesota Hounds, California Waves, Texas Cowboys, Chicago Red Birds, and Kansas City Kings.

4. American Division East: Toronto Bears, Boston Hornets, New York Rebels, Detroit Wheels, Milwaukee Marshals, Baltimore Eagles, and Cleveland Tomahawks.

Each team has a set of players the make up the team each with their own skill level and statistics which, like the teams, is fictional other then Clemens himself who is on the Boston Hornets team. 

When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of a &#8216;ball&#8217;.  The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball. 

The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.</desc>

		<desc>Not long after the malign reign of the Death Adder has ended, another evil rises. The peace of the land has again been threatened, this time by 'Dark Guld', who was supposed to be imprisoned but apparently isn't. He has instead now got his hands on the Golden Axe, and is using it for his own nasty purposes, and with his minions is causing much chaos.

So once more, Ax-Battler, the fierce barbarian; Tyris-Flare, the fearless Amazon; Gilius Thunderhead, the ferocious dwarf; get up to deal with the oppression, with their might and magic, and recover the Golden Axe.

The hack and slash gameplay, in a medieval fantasy setting, is essentially the same to that of the previous game. Beat up opponents with melee attacks and collect scrolls to launch magical attacks. Moreover,  players can also ride dragons and other beasts and use their attack capabilities to their advantage.</desc>

Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra- high- tech- indestructible- super- space- cyber- suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. 

Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place.

Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit.

Gameplay is similar to the first game, with Jim jumping and running through the levels. There are 5 weapons more than the original game to collect. Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and Psy-Crow appear.</desc>

		<name>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia</name>
		<desc>This is one of the several games based on the anim&#233; series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!

Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.

Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!</desc>

The ring is done in pseudo 3D.

Your available moves are punch, kick, and grab.  You must try to wear down your opponent's life bar, then pin them.</desc>

		<name>Sonic The Hedgehog 2</name>
		<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog. Players run through different worlds called "Zones", each with a specific theme. There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress. Sonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels. When the player collects 100 rings they earn an extra life. The rings also act as protection - if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible. If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life. If the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the Special Stage. In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint. Complete all the checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds. The game also includes the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails. Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play. Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a "Spin Dash". This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where you need some momentum. The game also features a 2-player versus mode. This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones in the single player game.</desc>

With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

		<desc>The story takes place in 1999 where a Bio-Beast by the name of Godkaiser Hell has reigned supreme over Earth, after a nuclear and biological holocaust has disfigured most of the population and formed an army called the Steelmask Force.  The survivors have fled underground and are constantly attacked by the Bio-Beast horde until one day a scientist by the name of Dr. Kabuto creates a mech, the Mazinger-Z, that can be used against the monsters.  This is where the player takes control of the games protagonist and pilots the suit in an attempt to reclaim the Earth.

The gameplay is a hack-n-slash game, where the player controls the suit by using the D-pad and using the face buttons to slash at enemy monsters.  There is also a Super Attack that the player can use, but it will decrease their health after each use.  The enemies consist of mutant animals such as dogs and beetles as well as the Bio-Beast soldiers that can range from regular soldiers, female fighters and even ninjas.

There are five levels in all (Tokyo, Asia, Europe, New York and Egypt) divided into three stages with a mini-boss and a main boss the player must defeat to advance to the next level.  There are also items scattered throughout the levels that will give the player extra points, health refills, an extra life and even a brief stint of invincibility.</desc>

The games options allow the player to choose to play on 6 different field surfaces (grass, mud, dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf) and to choose how long the game will last (2, 5, 10 or 15 minute quarters). There are also no penalties in this game whatsoever. 

Gameplay consists of playing on both offense and defense. There are 26 different offensive plays and 18 different defensive plays to choose from. The game has a down the field view when on offense, so the game doesn't have receivers in windows.</desc>

		<desc>In this quasi-sequel of Wimbledon, Sega secured the ATP license, bringing 32 players (including Pete Sampras, John McEnroe and Stefan Edberg) plus a few others from the Senior Tour (among six others, legends such as Ilie Nastase and Stan Smith), as well as the option to create four players that can be developed in the ATP Tour mode. Each player has seven attributes that define their  control and power in both serve, forehand and backhand, as well as their footwork. Four court types are available which affect the speed and bounce of the ball in different ways, and 11 real ATP tournaments are available to play.

There are three game modes: Exhibition match, Exhibition Tournament (where the player competes in a 32-player tournament), ATP Senior Tour Event (where the player chooses one of the retired players and competes in a 8-player tournament) and the ATP Tour, where it's possible to create a player and develop his skills by winning (or simply doing well) on tournaments, with one extra point on each round won.

Gameplay uses a simple 3-button layout, where the A button lobs the ball, B performs a controlled passing shot and C allows the fastest top spin shots, with the directional pad affecting the direction and depth of the shot.</desc>

		<name>The Hybrid Front</name>
		<desc>The Hybrid Front is a turn-based strategy video game, released in Japan (exclusively) for the Mega Drive.

The introduction begins with someone logging into a computer. Then, it shows a revolution that occurred sometime in the 2080s leading into a series of wars and conflict that lead up to the video game's main setting of the 26th century. Since the second half of the 21st century, the depletion of fossil fuel resources have helped to deepen the conflict on Earth...
During the 24th century, the Earth was bombarded from orbit with massive optical weapons called the Metal Hammer by an Italian consortium; major cities around the world were burned to toast. The resistance would eventually be put down by CoCoON (abbreviation for COoperation COmmunity of Orbital Negotiation). Not only they would gain the corporate hegemony of humanity, CoCoON would develop a reputation as a hostile group of corporate war hawks; constantly revolting against the peaceful coalition of the PETO (abbreviation for Pan Earth Treaty Organization).

		<desc>Yuri Sakazaki has been kidnapped! Her big brother Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, his best friend, go search for her on the streets of South Town. As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>

		<name>Dahna : Megami Tanjou</name>
		<desc>Dahna: Megami Tanjo (Dahna: Birth of a Goddess) is a beat'em up with some RPG elements. The player controls Dahna as she scrolls horizontally or vertically through the levels. Dahna fights her enemies using a sword, and she can jump in two heights, duck and crawl. Dahna has also a magic meter, which has several colored levels. Different levels of her magic will produce different magical effects (as in Golden Axe). Her magic can be replenished by gathering magical orbs, dropped by enemy mages when killed. They will also drop health orbs as well.

She starts the game "riding" a giant, and in other portions of the game, she'll also ride other creatures, such as a horse and a griffin. When riding a creature, Dahna can't use her magic powers.

As she kills enemies and gather orbs, Dahna gains experience points, which grant her level upgrades. Leveling up affects only her health, as she gains more health points.</desc>

		<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.

The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</desc>

Waku Waku Shopping is a sugoroku-style board game based on the popular characters created by Momoko Sakura. The game takes place on a board made up of various spaces: there are spaces which increase or decrease the character's money or happiness, spaces where the player can spend their money to buy things to increase their happiness, and spaces that trigger various events. The game ends when the goal has been reached a set number of times, and the winner is the player with the most happiness at the end of the game. Up to four players can play, with the computer taking control of any remaining characters.</desc>

		<name>Math Blaster : Episode 1</name>
		<desc>A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, Math Blaster: In Search of Spot is an educational title with arcade elements designed to help students learn maths while having fun.

The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals, percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets (present in the PC version only).

Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.

The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately, for practice or for score.

The activities are as follows:

1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam to collect space trash.

2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash you collected into fuel.

3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels, monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.

4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time limit.

Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a high score board for their account.</desc>

		<name>Mutant League Hockey</name>
		<desc>Mutant League Hockey is a violent hockey game in the same series as Mutant League Football.  There are 23 bizarre hockey teams to choose from, with players consisting of zombies, skeletons, trolls, and robots.  The arenas are equally strange, with hidden bottomless pits, mines placed under the ice, spikes, and a "Demon Net" that functions as a goalie by chomping up and down and devouring the puck.
The game plays similar to normal hockey, except in this game your players can pick up chainsaws, maces, axes, etc. to use against the competition.  It's a bloody game, with opponents exploding into piles of goo (or circuits if they are a robot) when they become too injured.  The player can call special plays, like an exploding puck or jail break and attack the goalie.  The game also has fighting sequences if two players decide to get into a brawl.  
The game comes with multiplayer and a playoff series, full stats for your players and instant replays.</desc>

		<desc>Pro Yakyuu Super League '91 is a baseball game developed by Sega that was released in 1991. The game was localized in the west almost a year later as Sports Talk Baseball, which featured an official MLBPA license.

Instead of a running commentary, Super League '91 uses a constant soundtrack of Japanese drums during the game and a remix of the umpire voices to a techno tune at the main menu. There is no way to view any advanced statistics other than at the end of the game in the Japanese version (i.e., errors and hits). All the players names are written in hiragana, with English letters being used only to show field position and the status of the player.</desc>

		<desc>Late one night, the malevolent Thump enters the Gadget Kingdom's castle and steals the Gadget King's gem. The king wakes up the next morning to find that his gem was stolen. The king then summons Bop and Bump to reclaim his stolen possession from Thump.

Gameplay consists of flying through six air and water levels: Gadget Bay, Zeppelin Attack, The Lost City, Sub Attack, The Crystal Lake and Thump's World. Although the game continually scrolls throughout its stages, the player can fly in all directions on the screen. Bop and Bump come equipped with a spring glove mechanism that lets the player punch either up, down, right or left, which is used to defeat enemies.

Defeated enemies drop coins. There are also chests littered throughout the stages which contain coins also. These coins can be spent at a shop where the player can purchase upgrades.

The game also contains bonus stages where the objective is to open all the chests in a limited amount of time.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the world of Greek mythology, Phelios tells the story of a young prince called Apollo, who sets out to rescue his beloved Artemis who was seized by the demon Typhon while exploring the skies with the winged horse, Pegasus. In Typhon's temple, Artemis gets locked in a dungeon where Medusa turns her into stone.

Phelios consists of seven chapters, and in each, you must defeat Typhon's minions using your sword which can emit fireballs at them. However, holding the fire button down for a few seconds will charge the sword; and upon releasing it, it shoots a larger fireball that does a fair amount of damage. During the game, you collect items that increases your speed and give you more firepower.

At the end of each chapter, you have to destroy a boss in order to proceed to the next one. Between each chapter, you can watch an intermission that details what is happening at the temple.</desc>

The game is played from a side-scrolling third person perspective in which you can move in any direction in a closed arena (limited by the cheering crowds and other street elements). You have to face eight unique fighters in succession by using your attacks in standard beat 'em up fashion against the progressively more difficult adversaries.

As a unique feature, you can bet money on the outcome of the fights, and if you win you can use that money to upgrade your stats to suit your playing style. 2-player gameplay is included in a Vs mode (the arcade original had co-op gameplay) and a new special move that depletes part of your lifebar has been added.</desc>

Similarly to  Sonic games, Bubsy moves very fast and can also jump very high. Bubsy kills the enemies by jumping on their heads. The levels are large and can be accessed right from the beginning of the game (except the ultimate level), starting in either west or east wing. There are five types of regular levels: Egyptian pyramid, sci-fi space-like environment, a world filled with musical instruments and notes, a "green" level with trees and hills, and a side-scrolling group of levels where Bubsy has to navigate an airplane.</desc>

The player has a realistic range of moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high.

You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when you feel you are ready, you can travel to the martial arts world championship tournament at Budokan.</desc>

The biggest change from FIFA International Soccer are obviously the dozens of club teams from England, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, United States, Spain and Brazil, taking the team number tally to over 200. This also increased the number of competitions, with each country  having it's own League, Tournament and Playoff. Also new, a battery backup allowed to save up to four competitions in the cartridge, replacing passwords. For those who want to settle things the fast way, a Penalty Shootout training mode was added.

While graphically the game only received minor changes to the isometric sprite engine, gameplay feature new moves such as volley kicks and more detailed headers (now more effective), as well as general controls being more responsive facilitating passing play, and goalkeepers now are smarter when chasing balls. Set pieces also received a new format, and instead of just kicking the ball the player can choose to play a predefined set piece.</desc>

		<name>MegaPanel</name>
		<desc>Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Tetris Attack and a traditional sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, and potentially create chains from the blocks above falling. As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.

The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a "pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.</desc>

		<name>Newman-Haas IndyCar Featuring Nigel Mansell</name>
		<desc>Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell. 

The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.
A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.

Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.</desc>

		<desc>Young Simba just can't wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</desc>

		<desc>Super Monaco GP is a modified conversion of the arcade game, a first-person perspective racing game. As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible.

The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however.  In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car.  By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.</desc>

In this action game, you navigate your character in top-down view and continuously fire at enemies, turning him in different directions, since he doesn't always face the direction he is moving in. You can for example walk backwards, firing at the enemies who pursue you. Enemies include not only various types of gunmen, armed with rifles, flamethrowers, or grenade launchers, but also tanks and helicopters. You can blast open crates to find ammo and supplies. Defeated enemies also leave you items.</desc>

		<name>Phantasy Star IV</name>
		<desc>The Algo star system is in troubled times...

Many thousands of years ago, the Algo Star System was a peaceful system. Three planets surrounded the peaceful Algo star and were in perfect harmony: Palma, a lush green planet, where its citizens devoted their lives to arts and the sciences. Motavia, a desert planet, inhabited by humans and native Motavians, and the enigmatic Dezolis, a harsh ice planet, where the citizens were just as unknown as the planet itself. Unfortunately, the harmony and balance was not to last. Palma had exploded, and with it, 90% of the population of Algo died. Motavia had fallen into horrible conditions from the explosion, turning almost into a total wasteland. The Darkness spread its hand over the land...

Now, 1,000 years had passed. Motavia had healed somewhat, and life was beginning to return to the way it once was thousands of years ago. The Hunter's Guild on Motavia helped to keep things steady. But now, a dark evil once thought to be long dead is beginning to stir once again, and the young Hunter, Chaz, is about to begin his ultimate adventure - and all of it started with one simple routine assignment...

The gameplay of the fourth entry in the  Phantasy Star is similar to that of the  second installment, sharing notable features such as the ability to equip two weapons at once, different healing items for humans and androids, most of the "techniques" (equivalent to magic spells in comparable games), etc. As before, leveling up and technique-learning is automatic. There are a few segments in the game with vehicle combat, which mostly follows the same turn-based formula as the regular battles. Side quests are present in form of hunter assignments for Chaz and his friends.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the film of the same name, this game puts you in John Rambo's shoes as he travels to Afghanistan to free Colonel Trautman from the Soviets.

In six missions, Rambo must complete various objectives. Besides finding the exit of the level, prisoners must be freed and enemy ammunition supplies destroyed. Rambo is controlled from an overhead perspective and has several weapons at his disposal. Besides a machine gun that never runs out of ammo, he can use a knife for close range kills, set off timed bombs and use his famous crossbow with explosive arrows. Ammunition for the bow and the bombs is limited and can be collected from dead enemies.

After some of the missions, the perspective switches to a view behind Rambo and additional boss fights take place. Soviet tanks or helicopters must be destroyed using the crossbow. While aiming the bow, Rambo cannot move, but otherwise he can hide behind rocks or other obstacles from enemy fire.</desc>

Your goal: run through six different desert environments before time expires, collecting ACME stamps.

The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.</desc>

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</desc>

		<desc>In the past, a terrible war raged between the Gods, the creators of the world, and the Titans. The Titans were defeated thanks to a super-powerful weapon forged by the Gods, called the Golden Axe. Thanks to this weapon, the Titans were banished, and the Gods bequeathed the Earth to humans. However, one Titan had survived: Death Adder. He seized the Golden Axe and used it to lay waste to the world. He kidnapped the king of Yuria and his daughter and threatened to execute them if the inhabitants did not submit unconditionally. Three heroes, determined to take revenge on Death Adder, set out to find him.
Each character has a special magical ability that can be charged by kicking small creatures that drop a potion.</desc>

As well as the 24 teams who qualified for the tournament, other significant footballing nations like England, France and Denmark could be drafted in. The presentation of the menus is largely icon-based, with the official mascot featuring prominently. Tackling is difficult and passing is easy, making for a flowing end-to-end style of play.</desc>

		<name>Monster World IV</name>
		<desc>This is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. You control Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.

Monster World 4 is essentially a platform game, with slight RPG/adventure elements (puzzles, treasure, equipment, etc.) Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the "down" button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

The game was released only in Japan. It is sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".</desc>

In New York, Wolverine must make his way through the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, an underground dungeon, and the NYC sewers for a final showdown. Lots of enemies stand in his way: flying robot drones, armed guards, The Hand ninjas and Inner Circle bodyguards, among others. He can take them out with basic jumps, kicks and slashes, as well as link the basic moves into more powerful combos. When Wolverine takes damage, his mutant healing factor kicks in, (slowly) regenerating his health. Health packs should be sought out, however, because just sitting around waiting for the health to recharge is not an option: a timer slowly ticks down to the appearance of the android girl Elsie Dee, designed to destroy Wolverine. Her embrace means instant death.</desc>

		<name>Zero Wing</name>
		<desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (or the European PAL version) is best known for being the origin of the infamous "All Your Base" 2001 Internet meme.</desc>

Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.</desc>

Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship.  Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161.  Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

		<name>Battlemaster</name>
		<desc>An early squad based combat strategy game set in a medieval style fantasy world.

The player decides which race they want to play (Human, Orc, Dwarf or Elf) each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is then a matter of clearing out areas of opponents and finding items to enhance your character's and companions abilities. 

There are many traps to avoid and death is a constant in what most people would find a very tough game. 

The nearest game to compare it to would be Rage Of Mages, though that has more of an RPG focus, it does bear aesthetic similarities and a squad based fantasy fighting theme.</desc>

		<desc>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system

FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</desc>

		<name>Demolition Man</name>
		<desc>Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. As with the movie, the game takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. John Spartan is the country&#180;s most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.

Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of "cryocons" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.

The Sega CD version of the game retains identical levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.</desc>

		<name>After Burner II</name>
		<desc>Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

		<name>Joe &amp; Mac</name>
		<desc>The game stars the green-haired Joe and the blue-haired Mac, cavemen who battle though numerous prehistoric levels using, weapons such as boomerangs, bones, fire, flints, electricity, stone wheels, and clubs. The objective of the game is simply rescuing a group of girls who were kidnapped by a rival tribe of cavemen. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Contra and has a Gauntlet-style health system, where the player loses health over a period of time apart from in boss battles. This health system is also not unlike that of Sega's Wonder Boy. The game could be played in either single player or two player mode. In the two player mode, both characters could hurt each other. The game was also notable for its cartoony graphics, humor, and sound effects.

The original arcade version had the distinction of allowing the player to select between different routes (much like Taito's Darius) at the end of a boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.</desc>

		<name>Brutal : Paws of Fury</name>
		<desc>The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. 

Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. 

During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. 

Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. 

The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.

In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.</desc>

		<name>NHL Hockey '94</name>
		<desc>After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in NHL '94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in the series.

Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides). 

While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</desc>

		<name>Hit the Ice : VHL, The Official Video Hockey League</name>
		<desc>Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team's goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a "super shot" which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.

Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a "shot race" mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</desc>

		<name>Metal Fangs</name>
		<desc>Metal Fangs is a unique futuristic battle driving game, where the player controls a team of racers and must attempt to destroy the competing team. Each "race" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other team earns points. During each heat, each team takes one turn attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The team with the most points at the end of the last heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match.

However, your team won't get very far with just its basic equipment. After choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.

After each successful match there is a game of chance where winnings can be increased. There is also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.</desc>

		<name>The Great Waldo Search</name>
		<desc>Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of books, the player's goal is to find Waldo, who is hidden in various pictures, before the time on the clock runs out. The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.

Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.

In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.</desc>

		<name>Tetris</name>
		<desc>Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, this one is based on the 1988 coin-op version produced by Sega. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

In addition to a standard endless mode for one or two players, the game also includes a "time trial" mode for one or two players, where the goal is to get as many points as possible in three minutes. There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling their own pieces simultaneously.

The game offers a number of standard options: setting the starting level, how much "garbage" is at the bottom of the well when the game starts, and whether the next piece is visible. There are also optional "item blocks," which are special flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they are used to clear a line.</desc>

		<name>Vixen 357</name>
		<desc>In 2384 AD, a great interstellar war took place. The Earth emerged victorious, thanks to a secretly developed robot weapon called "Serd". After the war, the usage of Serds was not a secret any more, and various nations started using them for military purposes. Several years, a more powerful weapon named Vector was developed. The usage of such highly destructive weapons led to wars between the nations of the world. You control Takuya Murasawa and his comrades, member of a special military force called Slash. Everything begins with an attack of unidentified Vectors on their base...

"Vixen 357" is an anim&#233;-style strategy/RPG game with mech combat. You control your robots by moving them over the battle map, and fighting enemies with long-ranged or mel&#233;e attacks. An animated battle sequence is shown when you and enemy robots attack each other. You can switch pilots in the robots and repair them during battles. Your pilots level up by gaining experience points, and you'll be able to acquire new robots and weapons during the game.</desc>

		<desc>Show do Milh&#227;o Volume 2 is a sequel to Show do Milh&#227;o, a game based on a Brazilian TV game show by the same name, hosted by Silvio Santos, a famous Brazilian TV presenter, owner of SBT, one of the greatest TV channels in Brazil. This sequel is exactly the same game as the previous one, except for the questions, all new.

Show do Milh&#227;o Volume 2 (One Million Show, in English) is basically a quiz game, with 16 questions divided in three blocks of five questions each, plus the one million question. Each question has 4 alternative answers, of which just one is right. The player has 40 seconds to answer, and wins a money prize for each right question. If he decides to stop at a certain question, he wins half of the questions' prize. If he guesses wrong, wins a quarter of the prize. But the rules are different for the last question: if he guesses wrong, he looses all the money he has won during the game. If he stops, takes half the prize as usual.

The player can also skip questions up to three times. If he skips a question, other one with the same prize is displayed. He can also ask for help, which comes in three different manners: cards, players and guests.

If the player chooses the cards help, he must pick one of three shuffled cards (K, A, 2 and 3), each one corresponding to the amount of wrong choices that will be removed from the screen (the K meaning no removal at all).

If the player chooses the other (in this case, simulated) players help, a screen showing the percentage of players guessing each answer will appear (in the real game show, many players participated each night, taking their turns at the central place).

If the player chooses the guests help, three guests will take their guesses on the answer, and you can go by their guesses or not (on the real game show, those guests were college students).

The game features the digitized voice of Silvio Santos, as well as the show's main theme. All the text is in Portuguese.</desc>

		<name>Shadow of the Beast</name>
		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<name>Outlander</name>
		<desc>Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.

The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.

Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.</desc>

		<name>Hurricanes</name>
		<desc>Featuring in a children's TV cartoon, The Hurricanes are the most revered team in the World Soccer League. The Gorgons are desperate to beat them in a key match - so desperate that they have made it hard for the team to even get to the stadium. Taking control of one of their star players, you must trek through the jungle, mines and a temple to get them to the stadium on time.

Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to 'influence' a license of a show about brilliant football players. Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.

In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.

The levels move from left to right but on several different vertical levels, and there is often more than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to Global Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 lives takes you back tot he last restart point - losing one of your continues takes you to the start of the world.</desc>

The player's only control over the ball is choosing the direction and power of the shot, and they must get the ball into the cup within par. Each of the 18 holes contains bizarre hazards like bumpers, lava pits, moving walls, and ice. For each stroke over par, the player loses one ball; if all balls are lost, the game is over.

		<desc>A tennis game featuring both an exhibition and a tournament mode. In the head to head exhibition mode, the player can choose their opponent (with the higher ranked opponents being better than the lower ranked ones). The tournament mode allows for 16 different players to compete to become the champion. Both of these modes can be played on either grass, hard, or a clay court. The player can also choose whether to be either a left or right handed tennis player.

During the game, whoever is serving the ball will be closer to the screen. Players will be able to use topspin, execute drop shots, perform volleys, lobs, slices and overhead smashes, and decide on either a hard or soft serve to keep the opponent off balance.

Although the game features fictional players, it is endorsed by Footlocker.</desc>

Shown from a slightly tilted 3rd-person side perspective, players can do an exhibition match, full tournament or go against a human player in the 2-player exhibition mode. The different teams are ranked by speed, offense and defence, and different team formations can be selected.

The gameplay is very basic: players can pass, shoot, tackle with a third button used to switch between players. In the options menu, fouls and offside can be disabled, the amount of time per half can be determined and there is a radar and mini-map to track the other players. The European edition is endorsed by Ryan Giggs and the game uses a password system to continue tournaments.</desc>

Once you get the ball into the top screen, you can hit a ramp shot to advance to the next level.  All told, there are nine levels, each with varying goals to complete. 

Four players can play in a round, with each player taking turns. There's also a bonus game where you play pong versus freaky exploding skeleton things.</desc>

It was built by Acclaim for North American Sega Mega Drive units, and contains watered down versions of NBA Jam Tournament Edition and Judge Dredd.

The event was organised in 1995, splitting contestants into categories - those aged under and including 13, and those aged 14 or above. Players could pick between Sega's console or Nintendo's SNES (which had a different cartridge - one produced by Rare featuring Donkey Kong Country). Each Blockbuster store in North America ran the event between June 14 and July 9, producing "store champions" who would then progress to further round in August, set at GamePro's headquarters in San Francisco. Despite the name it was not actually a "world championship".</desc>

		<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
   You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
   Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
   Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
   This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
   A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
   You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

		<desc>Help Barbie become a great fashion model!  This is an arcade game with many different activities to participate in.

In each level, Barbie starts by going left to right with forced scrolling.  She has a default speed and can speed up as well.  She must avoid moving obstacles by moving up and down and controlling her speed.  If she hits one, she loses a chance and it's game over if she runs out of chances.  She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.

There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot.  You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level.  You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit.  You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these.  You are awarded points for each correct match.

When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice.  This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one.

Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left.  On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up.  This brings you to another magazine cover.  You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover.  Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct.

When you reach the left side of the level, you must then do Barbie's runway walk that you were given earlier.  You are awarded points for each station at which you perform the correct move.

Barbie then continues to the next level.  There are a total of four: Barbie driving down the street, skating on the beach, walking through a ski resort and walking through the park.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.</desc>

		<name>Ball Jacks</name>
		<desc>Ball Jacks is a competitive action game taking place in the distant future. Two robot crabs, piloted by men seeking fame and fortune, face opposite each other in an arena. Behind them is a conveyor belt with large metal balls rotating around. The goal is to capture the opponent's balls and hold them until their timer runs out. Each crab has two claws which operate independently; they can be used to grab balls from the opposite side of the screen, as well as to knock them out of the opponent's grip. The player must also be careful, as taking a hit from behind will damage the crab, and if it takes too much damage then the crab must return to the pit area to be repaired.

There are several game modes included. The main focus is the World Championship mode, in which one player takes on a succession of increasingly skilled computer opponents. Also available is a two-player versus mode with a number of handicap options. There is also a training mode where the player can freely practice to get a feel for the controls, as well as a time trial mode where the goal is to grab as many balls as possible within the time limit.</desc>

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</desc>

Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite "Raiden". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship "Septemius 1" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, "Racoon", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. You are Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship "Septemius 2" that was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.</desc>

Rick has married Jennifer and they have a son, David. In the final chapter of this horror trilogy, Rick finds out that an entity called The Evil One has kidnapped his beloved family members. He has no choice but to wear the demon mask with the supernatural powers to save Jennifer and David from the demon-infested Splatterhouse.

The third title in the series builds upon the gameplay of its predecessors. The game consists of six consecutive levels in a huge mansion. In a race against time, you have to wipe the demons from each room and find the quickest path to the boss area. After clearing a room, you can use an in-game map to decide upon the quickest route. Improvements over the second title include moving between rooms in multiple directions, multiple endings based on your performance, special moves for Rick and crisper graphics.

It still has a horror theme and maintains the same level of gore and violence. You can collect weapons such as a skull-smashing baseball bat, an ax and cement blocks. If you get knocked down, a ghost will try to snatch your weapon and drop it in another room of the house. Other collectible items include extra lives, health meat or orbs. These orbs build up a power meter. Upon completion, you have the ability to transform into a berserk mutant for a short time. The cutscenes feature real actors who act out the characters.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2998, humanity has finally reached the stars, and was able to build a prosperous, peaceful society. However, a space matter known as the Black Nebula began to spread, threatening to engulf the galaxies controlled by humans. It turned out that a robotic dictator named Super Mech was behind this occurrence. The Earth sends Captain Lancer, a skillful pilot navigating the powerful CNCS1 aircraft, equipped with the most powerful weapon: the Hellfire...

This is a horizontal space shooter, with the traditional premise of a lone pilot traversing hostile areas and out-manoeuvring and/or destroying quick and numerous enemies. What sets this shooter apart from many other horizontal space shooters is that you choose the direction of your shots at any time between forward, backward, upward+downward and 4-way diagonal. The 4-way diagonal shot is usually the most effective and makes for some interesting gameplay setups, such as stationary guns you can only reach by passing them (while avoiding their shots) and then placing yourself diagonally above them. There is also a bomb to take out multiple enemies. The game has a standard set of pickups: P icons for powering the weapons, S icons for increasing ship speed, B icons for bombs, and score icons.</desc>

		<path>./Time Killers (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Time Killers</name>
		<desc>Time Killers is a one-on-one versus beat-em-up with gameplay in a similar vein as Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2. 

What is primarily different is that you can attack with all body parts - the head, both arms and both legs. A damage system allows arms to be hacked off, but fighters can keep going with only legs and the head. A special feature allows the characters to perform a decapitation manoeuver called a 'death move' (similar to Barbarian), at any time during a round, instantly killing an opponent, and subsequently ending the round. The game features cartoon-like over-the-top blood and gore violence.

There are eight selectable characters, and each one has unique weapons and attributes pertaining to the period in time they are from, e.g. Thugg is a caveman with a stone axe from 20,000 BC, Musashi is a samurai from Feudal Japan 1496, Orion is an intergalactic bounty hunter with an electro-sword from 2885 etc.

In the single player game, if you manage to defeat all standard opponents, you can face off against Death himself.</desc>

		<desc>Based of the 1994 movie remake of Frankenstein, the player is the artificial man created by Victor Frankenstein. After Victor rejects his creation due to its hideous appearance, the creation flees from Victor and swears revenge on him.

The player goes through a number of levels, battling anything that attacks with a wooden stick. It's possible to set the tip of the stick on fire, by swinging it at the fire torches located on the walls. The player can also use a special attack: a blue ball coming out of the hands of the creation, which takes some of the player's life away. There are also some simple puzzles to be solved in order to get through the levels.</desc>

		<desc>Dick Vitale, the famous college basketball coach and commentator, lent his unique voice to this game for the Sega Genesis. There are four levels of depth to the commentary. Another aspect of the license is that the variety of offensive and defensive strategies and formations for player and AI use are pulled from the pages of Coach Vitale's own playbook.

The game features a 3/4 pseudo-3D perspective similar to that available on the SNES console in Mode 7. There are 32 college teams to choose from in four conferences, and games are played by official NCAA rules. Available gameplay modes include Single Game, 2-on-2, Slamfest (a simple slam-dunk contest), and Tournament. The AI can take control of defense, and the game can be played without foul rules.</desc>

Featuring a low-angle isometric view (not compensated by the d-pad, meaning pressing right will move the player along the half-way line (his right), not in the direction of the right corner flag (the screens' right) like in most games featuring axonometric views, while buttons allow to pass the ball in different strengths or kick at goal. Managing is limited to the choice of eight different formations at the start of the game and half-time.

Options include the usual in the genre: half length (3,5,10,20 and 45 minutes), weather conditions (sunny, rainy, overcast, indoors), referee strictness (full, no cards, no fouls), time stoppages, tie decision (shootout or overtime) and sound (music and sfx, only one of them or none).</desc>

The duel takes you through six worlds with three levels each.  In order to move on to the next world, you have to destroy the vehicle of your opponent, who has kidnapped the girl in each final level. Both singleplayer and multiplayer modes have horizontal split screens, which can be used strategically to slow down your rival.

The cowboys can jump, pick up weapons and dash at regular intervals to gain some extra speed. In order to win the level, you need to make use of the many obstacles. Some are meant to slow you down, but others, such as running shoes, skateboards or jump pads, can be used to improve your speed. There are multiple paths for each level as well.</desc>

		<name>Mickey's Ultimate Challenge</name>
		<desc>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</desc>

Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad!

The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</desc>

Osomatsu-kun: Hachamecha Gekijo (Nonsense Theater) is a side-scrolling action platformer based on the manga and anime created by Fujio Akatsuka, which plays similarly to Alex Kidd.

Each stage is made up of multiple areas; falling into holes in the ground leads to underground passages, and jumping onto flying shells leads up into the clouds.

		<desc>The premise is that two opposing forces are in combat with one another. Each player controls a jet airplane which zooms across the screen and may turn into a ground based soldier. These ground soldiers can hurt enemy units, but can not affect bases. To take over bases scattered across the map (and ultimately, the enemy base), players must purchase new units and transport them to certain positions. In this way, the player acts more like a transport and management for different types of units rather than a combat character themselves. If the plane is ever destroyed, it restarts at the player's base location. As previously mentioned, a level is complete when either side's base is lost to the opposing forces.</desc>

		<name>Beauty and the Beast : Roar of the Beast</name>
		<desc>Roar of the Beast is the second Genesis game based on the Beauty and the Beast animated film, only this time the player does not control Belle but Beast throughout the entire game. It is not a sequel to the first game, as both games were released in the same year. This title largely retells the story from Beast's perspective. It starts with Beast living in a castle in the dark woods with his servants (Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts). A powerful storm hits the castle and enchants all animals around it. Initially the beast needs to protect the magic rose against the creatures. Soon, Belle and her father Maurice become involved, and eventually the villagers who invade the castle.

The game takes place in Beast's castle and the surrounding woods. Through side-scrolling platform gameplay Beast can attack from three different stances (crouch, stand up, jump) and unleash a limited amount of roars that stun enemies for a short time. After regular levels, a sequence with a boss follows. There are also a few mini-games where Beast needs to finish a puzzle and catch rosebuds. Certain events are time limited. The game keeps track of the player's score, based on defeated enemies and collected treasures. There is an unlimited amount of continues and the story is told through static, drawn cut-scenes between missions.</desc>

		<name>Captain Planet and the Planeteers</name>
		<desc>Children growing up in the early 90s were worried about impending environmental doom. The popular Captain Planet cartoons told them they were doomed, unless a superhero could be formed by a multinational group of youths (the Planeteers of the title), to take on the polluters and deforesters.

Each of the five levels of this platform game has a specific mission and boss, and is undertaken by a specific Planeteer. These involve destroying hazards, shooting enemies, moving across suspended poles, and jumping onto ledges. 

You have four energy and four power units - more can be collected up to a limit of 8, and they will always be recharged to four (if necessary) when you reach a boss. You have an unlimited standard shot and a more powerful Super shot, which drains power.</desc>

		<name>Shura no Mon</name>
		<desc>Tsukumo Mutsu, a young student of Karate, has come to the city seeking the Jinmukan dojo, looking for a challenge to prove himself. He's gotten lost, but a young girl helps him out. She happens to be the granddaughter of the head of the dojo, and doesn't want him to get involved with the place, but Tsukumo insists on continuing regardless. He walks right in, and takes on the first guy in a karate gi he comes across...

Shura no Mon is a so-called "command action" game based on the manga by Masatoshi Kawahara. The player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from a list, using different attacks and defensive maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the results shown via brief animated sequences. Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes progress the story. The plot closely follows the first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.</desc>

Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.</desc>

		<name>Pyramid Magic</name>
		<desc>Pyramid Magic is a platform puzzle game that casts the player as a young explorer seeking a treasure hidden deep within a pyramid. Each stage contains blocks, treasure boxes, and an exit which is blocked by a ghost. The explorer can kick and destroy the blocks as well as carry them, and can also move through small openings by carrying blocks into them. However, if he falls even one square downward, the block will crush him and the stage must be restarted. He must collect the contents of each box in order -- the last contains an item which will dispel the ghost -- and reach the exit without either trapping or crushing himself with the blocks.

After clearing each stage, a time bonus is awarded, and an extra life is earned for every 3000 points. Every five stages, the player receives a password with which to resume play, and is also allowed to skip two stages. There are a total of 35 puzzles to solve.</desc>

The gameplay is fundamentally the same and has the player blasting invading aliens from Duke's point of view. This version has nine levels based off the PC's Lunar Apocalypse episode, and a range of enemies and weapons from the original game. The difficulty has been raised significantly, and the framerate is noticeably reduced. The port also makes heavy use of scanlines and a smaller window size to reduce the overall render load.</desc>

Mickey must find the missing musical notes scattered about in four imaginary worlds.  The Water World, Earth World, Air World and Fire World are filled with magical creatures such as marching brooms, skipping mushrooms, jumping cactus, flying horses, dancing hippos and many more.

The music in the worlds is straight from the movie, including pieces by Bach, Mussorgsky, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Dukas and Ponchielli.

Mickey must collect special items to keep up his strength and earn bonus points. Spell books, stars, crystal balls, potions and dinosaur eggs help him along the way. Enemies are dispatched by bouncing on them or casting small or large spells. If Mickey finds a wooden door he is led to a bonus area where he can collect many magical items.

At the end of each level, Mickey takes the notes he's found back to the orchestra's conductor who will send him back into the world to keep searching if he hasn't found enough of them or gained enough points.</desc>

		<name>Marvel Land</name>
		<desc>In the land of Coni, its inhabitants lived in harmony. At its center lies a mountain called "Peace", in which an amusement park known as "Marvel Land" resides. This park is well-protected by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became rule of the under dwellers and sent his minions to take over Marvel Land, imprisoning the Fairies inside crystal balls.

A young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue Wondra the princess, and free the Fairies from King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds with seven stages each, and the game plays in platform style, in which you need to run through the level, killing enemies, and find the exit door. More often than not, you have to go through a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at its center, you are awarded more points than you do by hitting it above or below.

You kill enemies by either jumping on their heads or attacking them with clones, which trail your movement unless you use them to attack enemies or collect food. The clones have a limited life and disappear one by one as you use them. 

During the game, you can open any treasure chests that you may find along the way, and release power-ups which include boots that make you increase your speed, dragon wings that enable you to jump higher and giving you the ability to glide to a soft landing, and giving you the use of the "clone" attack. Hidden throughout the sections are warp doors that can either take your backwards or forwards, anywhere within the park. Each section of a world has you riding a roller coaster, in which you must stay on the cars while avoiding signs and enemies.

The last section of each world has Talmit going through the castle to reach the end-of-world boss. Unlike other platform games where you must defeat bosses with weapons, you are challenged to various mini-games starting from "rock, paper, scissors" through to the Musical Chairs variant. If you win one of the mini-games, you are able to free one of the Fairies, and obtain a crystal ball that you need to defeat King Mole. You then proceed to the Bonus Stage where you must collect shooting stars for points. If you lose a mini-game, you are transported back to the start of the last section.</desc>

		<desc>Starting at 7.30 in the morning, the player has until 4PM to take a boat on the lake and fish for bass to beat competitors. The boat can be steered freely using a top-down view until an appropriate spot has been found by checking the lowrance monitor. The game then switches to a first-person view, also showing the fisher from a side-view on a separate part of the screen, and it is possible to look around in the environment.

Casting is done using a power meter to determine the distance. As the bait sinks, a monitor can be checked for nearby fish. There are also visual clues through splashing water. The player can check the depth and reel in when needed. When a fish has been caught, it becomes a sensitive play with the line tension to make sure it does not snap shown through the side-view of the fisher. At the end of the day the boat can go back to the weighing area to determine the results. Money earned in the tournaments can be used to acquire new spin reels, bait reels, boats, lines and lures.</desc>

		<desc>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</desc>

		<name>Sensible Soccer : European Champions</name>
		<desc>With the original Sensible Soccer having sold hugely, this updated version was released some months later (and then used as the basis for the later console versions). The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account. 

The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one "professional foul" (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.</desc>

		<desc>F1 Circus '91 is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. The series did not yet feature an official license, and so just like the first game it only features generic team and driver names. The game itself plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.</desc>

		<desc>Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.

A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group Bomb The Bass.</desc>

The main draw of this particular version is online play through a phone line, but this service has long since been discontinued. Unlike many baseball games, Tel-Tel Stadium takes a rather hands-off approach to the action, allowing the player to give commands to the batter, pitcher, and fielders rather than directly controlling them. In addition to the now-defunct online mode, it can be played single-player offline with an exhibition match, as well as a "pennant mode" where the player builds their own team and plays through a full season. There is also the option to watch a computer-controlled match.</desc>

		<name>T2 : The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</desc>

		<desc>The Misadventures of Flink is a Jump'n Run set in the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.

Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. 
Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</desc>

		<name>Super Smash T.V.</name>
		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.</desc>

The only pony who is still free is Crystal Pony. She must now carefully explore the surroundings, find gems that are scattered in various places, and use them in places where the ponies are captured to release them.

You navigate your pony through various locations, collecting horseshoes on your way and "paying" them at level gates to pass to another location. You can explore the locations in any order you wish, traveling directly between them or using teleportation pictures. The game has more adventure than action elements. Crystal Pony cannot die in the game; if an enemy hits her, she merely loses one of her horseshoes. The only battles are against the witch, occurring every time you use a gem at the correct place. The pony would automatically jump over obstacles, but you can also make her jump with a corresponding button. You can get extra items by interacting with various objects and characters, pressing the action button.</desc>

The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.</desc>

		<desc>Doki Doki Penguin Land MD is a 16-bit remake of the classic Master System puzzle game Penguin Land. The player controls a penguin who must get an egg from the top of each stage to the bottom, where his girlfriend is waiting for him. The player must break ice blocks to open a path, but if the egg falls too far, it will break. There are numerous hazards that the player must watch out for, including moving platforms, solid iron blocks, blocks that will break as soon as the egg touches them, moving spikes, and tubes through which only the penguin or the egg can pass.

The player can also find special items to help out; hearts will increase the bonus score, wings let the penguin jump higher, and iron eggs let the egg fall further without breaking. There are a total of 30 puzzles to solve, with a password given every five stages. The game also lets you pause the game to view the entire map, as well as set a waypoint to return to should the egg break.</desc>

They leave mechanical "orbots" to clean up the mess they made on Earth through littering and pollution. Raster, a high-level orbot who watches Earth through a planetwide computer network, is accidentally attached to a working nuclear missile by a lesser orbot and goes insane, becoming an evil dictator named Warhead. He declares himself ruler of Earth, and begins preparing to execute any humans who dare return to their planet.

Enter Vectorman, a humble robot in charge of cleaning up toxic sludge by simply discharging it into the sun. As he lands on Earth after his last trip, he finds chaos and confusion. Because all the other Orbots are controlled by Warhead (Vectorman having not been affected because he was away), Vectorman takes it upon himself to destroy the errant orbot and restore peace to Earth.</desc>

While the original let you play one of three different monsters to go through side-scrolling beat'em-up stages and fight (non-playable) monster as boss enemies, the Genesis version was re-worked into a one-on-one fighter similar to the first King of the Monsters game. 

Apart from Farmardy, all characters from the Neo Geo version are playable. To win, the player must defeat all other monsters and a clone of the played monster in a fight. The matches take place in areas built from the original levels, and feature destroyable landscapes and secondary enemies, both of which can be smashed to gain points and power-ups.</desc>

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called "Cyber-Shredder" here).

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to rescue April and Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</desc>

It is set in a typical medieval fantasy setting and features traditional turn-based combat. The player controls several generals who can command up to eight different units ranging from ordinary soldiers and archers to more exotic creatures like mermen or lizards.The generals fight alongside their units, however they are much more powerful and are able to use more diverse commands than just moving and attacking, like recovering a small amount of HP or casting spells. Each unit has certain strengths and weaknesses; for example soldiers are good against archers but weak against cavalry etc. Combat is also influenced heavily by terrain types. When two units engage in combat a small animation, similar to those seen in Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, is shown.</desc>

The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms  him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or  morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.

Graphics and sound remain faithful to the cartoony origins of the mascot.</desc>

		<name>Sesame Street Counting Cafe</name>
		<desc>Counting Cafe is an educational game based on the popular children's show Sesame Street. The player controls Grover, working as a waiter at a restaurant, where Mr. Johnson appears and orders various items. The player must take Grover into the kitchen, collect the items ordered, and return to Mr. Johnson's table, where he will reward the player with a star if the order is correct. If the player picks up the wrong items, they can be taken to Cookie Monster at the back of the restaurant, who will eat them and clear Grover's tray.

There are five sections to each "day" -- Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert. Once the player has completed Dessert, a monkey will run by and snatch the last star. Grover then must chase after the monkey to retrieve his last star, after which the game will move on to the next day.

After the first day, Sesame Street denizens will start appearing in the kitchen playing around with food items. Sometimes their activities with a food item will end up landing on Grover's tray, which may result in Grover carrying an unwanted food item, forcing him to give the food to Cookie Monster and having to collect the correct food items all over again.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</name>
		<desc>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. 

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.</desc>

		<desc>Nick and Tom are two Princes living the dream with two beautiful princesses. When suddenly the evil King Scorch freezes Prince Nick and Tom and kidnaps the Princesses. Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use  snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into  giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually  defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</desc>

		<name>Speedball 2 : Brutal Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.

You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.

The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.

You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.

A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</desc>

1. Paint: 

A paint program that offers different tools and brushes, a few pre-made backgrounds and objects as well as the option to import figures that were created in the sub-games 'Stylin' Stuff' and 'mix 'n match'.

Games: 

Mouse Maze: A Pac-Man-clone in which the player guides a mouse through a top-down labyrinth. To complete a level, all cheese symbol have to be collected while cats have to be avoided. Collecting a bone temporarily transforms the mouse into a dog that can kill the cats.

Space Lazer: A  shooter seen from the cockpit of a space-ship. The player controls a crosshair and has to shoot increasingly difficult enemies.

Whack a Clown: This game is exclusive to the Genesis Version and plays like 'Whac-a-Mole' only with clowns instead of moles.

Music: 

Songs can be composed by choosing from several instruments and putting notes onto a stave. It is also possible to add sound effects (animal noises and others) or edit provided songs.

Style: 

This section contains two mini-games:

Stylin' Stuff: Here, the player can edit the sprite of a woman by selecting different clothes, hats or haircuts.

mix 'n match: Sprites can be created by putting together different heads, torsi and legs.</desc>

		<name>Populous</name>
		<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</desc>

		<name>Ultraman</name>
		<desc>In the future, Earth must protect itself from alien invaders, a task handled by the Science Special Search Party. However, they are not alone in this endeavor. After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</desc>

		<name>Blue Almanac</name>
		<desc>In the distant future, mankind has long left the Earth and spread all over the Milky Way. Humans settled down on different planets, sometimes coming into contact with other races, and established a connection between them. The player is a nameless young man who was a mere child when he survived a spaceship crash and had to seek shelter on a new planet. Now he is sixteen, and his parents send him as a foreign student to the planet Terra. That is where his adventure begins!

Blue Almanac is a sci-fi console-style RPG. The player's party encounters random enemies and fights them in turn-based combat. The combat is viewed from a platform perspective and both the player's and enemies' attacks are animated.</desc>

Professor X's Danger Room is a training facility that can fully re-create environments in which the X-Men can practice their powers.  It's kind of like the holodeck on Star Trek.  One day, the danger room starts to go crazy, and randomly loading up dangerous simulations.  It turns out Magneto has loaded a virus into the Danger Room's computer, and now the X-Men have to stop it.

In this side scrolling action game, you can control one of 4 playable characters:  Gambit, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, or Cyclops.  In addition, you can call upon 4 other X-Men in when necessary.</desc>

Wonder Boy In Monster World puts you in control of Shion in his quest to save Monster World from the evil hands of BioMeka.  It controls like your standard platform game - run, jump, and kill enemies.  The game is filled with RPG elements such as talking to townsfolk, collecting money to buy items, upgrading your life, and equipping a variety of armor and weapons - staying very close to the "Zelda format".  You can save your game to continue your quest at a later time.

Wonder Boy In Monster World is the third game in the Monster World spin-off series.  In Japan the game is called Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3.</desc>

		<path>./NBA Jam - Tournament Edition (World).zip</path>
		<name>NBA Jam : Tournament Edition</name>
		<desc>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.

Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.

The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:

1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.

Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.

"Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.

"Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</desc>

Players can alternate from controlling Ren to Stimpy and visa versa. There ability vary greatly, even though they tend to use each other for their moves (i.e. Stimpy uses Ren as boomerang and Ren uses Stimpy as a bowling ball).

Another player can also jump in at anytime and play as either Ren or Stimpy.</desc>

Ys III breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games and allows Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.</desc>

The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.

The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</desc>

		<desc>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</desc>

		<desc>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. 

You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</desc>

		<desc>A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.

Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.

There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.

The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</desc>

However, the original mix of side-scrolling and top-view levels that was present in Thunder Force II has been dropped; only the side-scrolling levels remain.</desc>

		<name>Ecco Jr.</name>
		<desc>Ecco Jr. is a prequel to Ecco the Dolphin, set during his childhood. Together with his friends Tara the Whale and Kitney the Dolphin, Ecco goes looking for the legendary blue whale. Released after the two main Ecco games, this title is geared towards younger children with simplified gameplay, lacking the difficulty of the other Ecco games. The game also contains a number of educational facts about dolphins.

Set in the same underwater world, players choose one of the three characters to solve a series of challenges. These all involve harmless exploration and solving small puzzles with no foes or violent gameplay. The characters need to use their abilities to locate animals, herd seahorses, retrieve a sea lion's lost ball, swim through rings and locate glyphs. After completing the main tasks, a large glyph needs to be located to end the level. The characters can be switched at any time during gameplay, but they all have the same abilities. One button is used to send out a sonar pulse to locate items while another boosts the animal. Most levels take less than a minute to complete and there are eighteen levels in total.</desc>

Having been unable to save Jennifer, you keep having the recurring dream where she is begging you to come and rescue her. The mask from the Splatterhouse appears and promises that there is still a chance to save her. There is a downside to it, though. Wearing the mask of terror will fill you with feral rage and an insatiable hunger for blood.

Heavily influenced by films such as Evil Dead 2, the game takes you through eight, side-scrolling stages. Rick has a basic set of punches, kicks and flying kicks, but he can pick up additional weapons such as a lead pipes, bones, bombs, a shotgun and a chainsaw for the ultimate bloodfest, while fighting skulls, razor fish and giant demons. A boss, requiring a specific pattern of moves, awaits you at the end of each stage.</desc>

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

However, there was no place found for him either in paradise or in hell, and Koenma, the son of the death god Enma, sends him back to our world, where he has to be an "occult detective" and to fight against demons. Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yuusuke.

You must play the individual chapters of the four playable characters (Yuusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei), until in the final chapter you control them all in the ultimate confrontation against evil forces. The game is a Japanese-style adventure (no puzzles, menu-driven interface) with the addition of battles. The battles are real time; similarly to fighting games, you can kick, punch, defend, and use special techniques.

		<name>The Immortal</name>
		<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.

The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.</desc>

		<desc>It's a race to the moon for the two snakes, Rattle and Roll!  Play alone or simultaneously with a friend as you out-score and out-eat your opponent - then weigh yourself on the scales and make for the exit!

Snake, Rattle 'n Roll is an isometric 3D platformer.  The object of each level is to eat as many Nibbley Pibblies (round creatures of various colours) as possible to make your snake heavy.  Once it's heavy enough, you must stand on the scales in the level, and if you're heavy enough, the door will open and you can make your way to the exit.

As with many platform games of its era, Snake, Rattle 'n Roll is incredibly difficult.  Foes include Jaws, a monster that's all teeth and will kill you if you stay in the water too long, and Bigfoots, which stomp all over the place and require multiple tongue lashings to defeat.  Then there's the many types of Nibblies, such as Pibblesplats, which hop around and splat into puddles, Pibbleboings, which are spring-loaded and jump incredibly high, and Pibblewings, which fly high out of reach.

Two-player mode provides both a co-op and competitive experience: while you are both trying to eat more Nibblies than your opponent, if you both stand on the level's scale at the same time, both of your weights will be counted and it will be possible for you to exit the level more quickly.</desc>

		<name>Earnest Evans</name>
		<desc>The story of the game is connected to that of  El Viento. Earnest Evans is a brave treasure hunter. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist who searched for three legendary idols in the 1930s. It was said that those idols could bring disaster upon the Earth if fallen into the wrong hands. But despite his efforts, he could never find even one of the idols. Now it's up to the grandson to continue his work, fifty years later. But the evil syndicate leader Brady Tressider has his own plans, and will do anything to stop Earnest...

This is an action platform game in which you control Earnest Evans, armed with his trusty whip. The hero can jump, climb ropes, crouch, and crawl. There are plenty of obstacles on the levels (bottomless pits, spikes, crushing bridges, lava, etc.), as well as gangsters and monsters to dispose of.</desc>

		<desc>Sixteen levels (in four groups of four) await you in this long-developed Bitmap Brothers title. The basic gameplay is similar to Gauntlet, but in an open air setting, with bridges across rivers and such in the maps. The visuals are in the 'metallic and blue' style the Bitmaps appeared to favor.

There were 6 characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In 2-player mode you each chose a character and played co-operatively, but in one-player games you also choose a character for the computer to control, with its Artificial Intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on baddies away from the ones occupying your character.</desc>

		<desc>The game takes place in the summer of AW 1284, shortly before the events of Phantasy Star II.

Hugh Thompson (or Huey Reane)) is a scholar in biology at Motavia University. He's called in by the University president to investigate an incident involving an energy-sapping plant creature roaming the campus, feeding itself on electricity and steadily growing larger in the process. After the creature spreads itself through the college's reactor over to the main energy center, threatening to deprive the entire town of Kvarts of its electricity, Hugh sets out to try and stop it. This adventure is what eventually drives Hugh to adapt his knowledge of anatomy to combat biomonsters, in the aid of Rolf in Phantasy Star II.</desc>

		<desc>Whip Rush is a side-scrolling (with certain vertically scrolling descents and ascents) shooter similar to Gaiares and R-Type.

You start with 3, 4 or 6 ships depending on the difficulty level you select.

In addition to moving and shooting, your ship has Power Claws that you can rotate and extend for offensive and defensive purposes. Power Claws can be equipped up to two units and can shoot bullets.

The upgradeable weapons are Laser, Missile, Fireball and Power Claw.

Laser is forward firing only but is rapid and strong, missiles can shoot back and forth and when shot from the Power Claw they will home in on enemies. Fireballs shoot in the opposite direction of your ships travel.

Unlike most other games, your ship has variable speed, which comes in handy when negotiating different kinds of obstacles and enemies.</desc>

		<name>Joe Montana Football</name>
		<desc>Joe Montana Football for the Genesis is an action-oriented football game starring Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49'ers. Play a single game, a 2-minute drill or try to win the SEGA Bowl. Play against a friend or against the computer.

Both on the offensive end as well as on the defensive end there are 24 predefined plays for you to choose from (you can't create your own). If you don't know which play is appropriate you can always choose "Joe's Play" - a hint for inexperienced coaches. The nature of the gameplay is very "arcade-like". The game doesn't have GM functions, players statistics, player attributes, substitutions or any other coaching options. Just choose your scheme and execute it.

On the defensive side you can control any player you want, on the attack you control either the quarterback, a receiver, a running back or the kicker.

The game doesn't have a NFL license, so you'll play against Detroit or Chicago instead of the Detroit Lions &amp; the Chicago Bears. Joe Montana is the only NFL player (actually he's the only one with a name).</desc>

The game allows you to move your character in any direction, provided he doesn't leave the confines of the arena, and allows you to attack via mostly a combination of button presses that also trigger dodges and parries depending on the button pressed.

Graphics are 2D with a unique super-deformed design (stocky bodies with gigantic heads).</desc>

		<desc>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yu Honjo, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</desc>

		<desc>This game consists of five 3-day tournaments at four lakes. The mission is to catch as much large bass as possible. Once the day of the fishing tournament is over, the five largest bass that were caught get weighed and are compared to the other fisherman's catches. The one with the heaviest catch is the winner.

The player starts off choosing an angler. Then the player can either go to the bait shop, practice pond, or start in the tournament. In the bait shop, choices of baits, lines, rods, reels, fish finders, and boat engines are available for purchase. The practice pond mode is just where the player can cut his teeth on the game mechanics without consequence.

The tournament mode is the main part of the game. Players start out in a fishing boat. Some of the factors that can affect your fishing are temperature, wind speed, water clarity and time of day. After casting the line, the game goes from an above the lake view to a side view of the lake water depths. Then it's just up to the player to attract the fish with the bait, and after the fish is caught on the hook, reel it in.</desc>

		<name>Dark Castle</name>
		<desc>The Black Knight has brought misery to the land, and the end way to end this is to enter his haunted house to slay him. You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</desc>

		<name>The New Zealand Story</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat</name>
		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</desc>

		<path>./Alien Storm (World).zip</path>
		<name>Alien Storm</name>
		<desc>The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.

When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.

When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.

At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. 

You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</desc>

		<desc>California Games was the original "Extreme Games" &#8211; what today's generation might call "X-Games in the sun".  Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX.  The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.

The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.</desc>

		<name>Road Rash II</name>
		<desc>A motorcycle racing game with an attitude. You race in varying environments for ever increasing sums of money. With that money you can buy faster and better bikes. There are many objects on the road to watch out for, from cars to rocks to signs, if you hit one you'll go flying and loose valuable time. If you crash too often your bike can get wrecked. You can also attack other racers. The default attack is a punch, but some racers have weapons, which you can steal and use 
against them. The police patrol the various courses, so if you're not careful you can get busted. Road Rash II is not just a racing game but also a fighting game.</desc>
